This is a pretty comprehensive course that you will find very useful, as you go from the very basics of the language to the more complex components of it. It also provides a step by step explanation of the ways the language is structured, and provides interesting exercises to help you improve your understanding! I think you will like it. \n\nAdditionally, you may also want to check out the \"Finnish 1\" course by the University of Helsinki on Coursera. The first thing you need to know is that the course is fully in Finnish (with English subtitles) so you might find it a bit hard to get started. However, this can be a great way to dive right into the language. You can try and see if you are able to pickup on some basic vocabulary and grammar and if you manage to grasp some basic concepts, you can follow along with the subtitles and increase your understanding!\n"

And just like a well-designed machine, it follows a series of precise steps to break down food into energy and nutrients we can use!\n\nSo, let's break down the digestive system piece by piece. It all starts in the mouth, which is like the assembly line where food first enters the facility. You have the teeth that acts as shredders, breaking food into smaller pieces. Enzymes in your saliva will start the initial stage of chemical digestion.\n\nThen, once you swallow, the food goes down the esophagus, which is basically a tube that leads to the stomach. Think of it like a slide that carries the chewed food down. What happens next?\n"

You're probably wondering how light, something we see every day, connects to the craziness of quantum mechanics, right? \n\nWell, think of it this way: in the quantum world, everything is both a particle *and* a wave. Light is no exception. We used to think light was *just* a wave, like ripples in a pond. But then came quantum mechanics, and suddenly, light could also act like a stream of tiny particles, called photons.\n\nSo, does this mean that light is only a wave or a particle?\n"

And since you love step-by-step learning, I'll make sure to point you towards courses that break down complex topics into manageable pieces.\n\nFirst up, there's \"The Theoretical Minimum\" series on YouTube by Leonard Susskind. Susskind is an amazing teacher. He's like the Feynman of theoretical physics \u2013 super clear, engaging, and he really knows how to make tough concepts understandable. This series covers everything from classical mechanics to quantum mechanics and general relativity. Because the courses are structured around lectures, you can expect to learn the basic concepts in a step-by-step way. This is a great option to expand your knowledge of theoretical physics.\n\nThen, you might want to check out \"Mathematics for Machine Learning\" on Coursera by Imperial College London. Given your interest in physics and math, this course will provide you with the fundamentals to understand the math behind AI. It will help you to build a solid mathematical foundation. This course will introduce you to the basics of Linear Algebra and Calculus, covering the most relevant concepts for Machine Learning in a step-by-step manner.\n\nI think you will enjoy learning with these courses!\n"
