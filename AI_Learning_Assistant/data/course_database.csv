json105.json,Pathway of Disruptive Innovation,"Disruptive technologies have dramatically reshaped the landscape of go-to-market strategies in the last decade. Emerging technologies, such as AI, IoT, and blockchain, have not only accelerated the pace of innovation but have also altered the fundamental approaches to bringing products and services to market. In the recent past, traditional strategies often followed a linear path, where companies meticulously planned product development, market entry, and scaling processes. Today, with the advent of disruptive technologies, this linear approach is no longer sufficient. Instead, we witness a more dynamic, agile, and customer-centric approach.

One significant change is the speed of adaptation. Disruptive technologies require companies to swiftly pivot and experiment with their strategies. They encourage a 'fail-fast' mentality, where iterations and learning from mistakes are integral to success. Moreover, data-driven decision-making is now at the core of modern go-to-market strategies. The rise of digital platforms and e-commerce has also transformed the reach and accessibility of markets. Companies can now tap into global audiences with minimal physical presence. This shift is forcing traditional brick-and-mortar businesses to reimagine their models.

json118.json,Facing Climate Change with remote sensing,"Observations from weather stations have been widely used to study climate change over a long period of time. However, due to the scarcity of point-based weather observations, our understanding of the Earth’s changing climate is very limited. This impedes the advancement in our knowledge of the Earth’s climate system and our capability to develop well-suited climate models to simulate future climate change, which further results in considerable uncertainties associated with future climate projections. How to quantify and minimize these uncertainties is thus becoming one of the most challenging issues to be addressed for climate change impact assessment and adaptation studies. Remote sensing offers a new way of observing the Earth’s climate system with continuous and high-resolution spatial coverage through satellite-based, aircraft-based, or drone-based sensor technologies. This can significantly improve our understanding of climate change and its potential impacts at global, regional, and local scales. The data collected with remote sensing technologies can also be used to validate our climate models, improve our knowledge of the physical and dynamical processes of the climate system, and help us to project future climate change and its impacts with minimized uncertainties.

When it comes to the term’s sensors and research, you have to look very closely at what it is all about in the end. From the Smart Sensors department, research focuses on the sensor systems themselves, while at the same time sensors are an important component in various multidisciplinary research activities.

json136.json,Circular Sustainable Business Development,"**Ready to Lead the Shift to a Circular Economy?**

The world is moving away from the wasteful linear economy toward a more sustainable, circular one, and it’s shaping the future of business. Engineers, business leaders, managers, and policy-makers are all needed to drive this change. Want to be one of the graduates leading the way? Circular Sustainable Business Development is the course for you! This exciting, multi-disciplinary course is open to all master’s students at UT.

**Why Circular Economy Matters**

In a world focused on sustainability, the circular economy is key to transforming how we produce and consume. As future decision-makers and leaders, it’s essential for students to understand the circular economy in relation to the triple bottom line: People (social impact), Planet (environmental impact), and Profit (economic viability). Through this course, you'll learn how to integrate these elements into business strategy and explore corporate social responsibility from all angles.

**What You’ll Learn**

The course kicks off with the basics of sustainable and circular economies, packed with real-world examples of success stories at the global, national, and regional levels. From there, you’ll work on a challenge-based group project (worth 25% of your grade) to tackle specific sustainability problems.

**Core Topics Covered:**

- **Sustainable Business Models:** Discover how companies can create value from an economic, environmental, and social perspective using the Triple Layered Business Model Canvas (BMC). This tool will allow you to think beyond just profits, incorporating life cycle and stakeholder perspectives.
- **Real-World Impact:** Explore how different sectors, from manufacturing to pharmaceuticals and agri-food, are affected by sustainability, and learn the techniques for measuring sustainability effectively.
- **Sustainability in Supply Chains:** You’ll dive into value recovery from end-of-life products and learn how businesses can shift from linear to circular models. A serious game simulating real-world decision-making will reinforce your learning (worth 25% of your grade). This game will take place at the campus of the University of Twente in Enschede, the Netherlands (see Participant information).
- **Hands-On Experience:** From Life Cycle Assessments to agent-based modeling and game theory, you’ll develop practical skills that will help you lead sustainable business practices.

**Engage with Big Ideas**

In the final weeks, you’ll explore cutting-edge topics driven by your own interests—like food waste, electronic waste management, or the evolution of eco-industrial parks. You’ll finish the course with a final individual written exam (worth 50% of your grade) that ties everything together.

json158.json,The sustainable forest challenge,"New sustainability programs at the EU level, such as the Nature Restoration Law, One Health Program, and the EU Biodiversity Strategy, raise questions for natural resource-based companies on how to integrate restorative and regenerative practices while ensuring long-term viability. For Södra, a leading Swedish forestry cooperative, the forest is more than just a source of renewable raw material for the Södra industries—it provides climate benefits, ecosystem services, long-term economic potential, and represents a core of Swedish innovation. Moreover, forests are a shared spaces for both people and wildlife, offering both livelihood and recreation.  

Södra is Sweden’s largest forest-owner association, founded in 1938 and today a strong cooperation of 52,000 individual forest owners. Members are diverse, ranging from farmers who actively manage their forests to city-dwellers who have outsourced the work. With local roots in southern Sweden and a presence in the global market through its industrial activities, Södra’s primary mission is to ensure the profitability of its members’ forest estates and to secure markets for their raw materials. This is achieved through a focus on high-value industrial segments and a balance between productive forestry and nature conservation, while always respecting members’ property rights. Innovation, sustainability, and the interests of the forest owners guide the cooperative’s work, with the ambition to create sustainable value from every tree.  

As the importance of sustainability has grown, Södra has integrated this focus across almost all levels of the organization. At the same time, public opinion on how forests should be managed is shifting, and Södra must continuously adapt and develop its practices to remain competitive—both in the market and among its members.  

In light of this educational challenge and aligned with recent developments in EU legislation, Södra needs to consider whether it is time to proactively redefine its strategies. Aligning with forthcoming and expected regulations and programs is not only a matter of compliance but a strategic opportunity. By acting early, Södra can strengthen its position as a leader in sustainable forestry and turn these challenges into new market opportunities. Innovation in products and services that support biodiversity and ecosystem health will allow Södra to meet the growing demand for sustainability. Moreover, by focusing on regenerative practices, Södra can further establish itself as a pioneer in combining ecological restoration with long-term economic resilience and Swedish innovation.

The reality of climate change is imperative for societies to innovate and action solutions that can advance the world to a more sustainable future. Bringing digital technologies and sustainability goals together is logical, and necessary, and today Digital Twins are already having a radical impact on sustainability. By its nature, digital technologies are adaptable and responsive to innovation – but technology providers do not have a monopoly on ideas. This challenge seeks new ideas, and original thinking, to apply Digital Twin technologies to sustainability goals.  

**Digital Twins**  

Digital twins are virtual counterparts of tangible assets, providing real-time data, optimisation, predictive analytics, and alerts. The significance of DT isn't confined to engineers or facility managers, it's equally valuable for end-users and property owners. A pivotal area where digital twin technology shows promise is in real-time sustainability monitoring.  

Digital Twins can significantly improve the design, construction, and operation of assets of all types. It can improve efficiency by monitoring performance in real time, including carbon outputs. It is envisaged that Digital Twins should simulate entire systems or interlinked assets to simulate future effects of climate or citizen actions. They should enable society to do more with less, to utilise resources better, longer, and to recycle where replacement has been the norm, to align engineering data with reality, geospatial, IOT and other operational data. By means of IoT data, Digital Twins should allow AI and machine learning to better analyse performance and improve efficiency.  

If the above is true – what are the opportunities yet unseen, what has not been envisaged, and where are the next true innovations?

In this course we will holistically assess complex system behaviors by examining their various complexities, including technical, human, political, resource, and environmental processes. Thereby, we aim to understand how changes and various design solution alternatives impact the extended life of systems and organizations.  

Exploring how to manage changes in the design, development, and deployment of systems requires individuals to conceptualize and understand the inherent complexities. It also requires ongoing planning and implementing organizational, team, or individual change within the working environment.

json186.json,Adultcentrism in Educational Relationships,"This challenge addresses an often-neglected dimension of diversity and inclusion which is ‘age’, particularly ‘minor age’. Adultcentric bias can create barriers in recognizing the capacities of children and youth to contribute to society as they can be pre-judged to be ‘incompetent’ or ‘not-yet developed’ due to their age. Raising critical self-awareness of adultcentrism among adults in educational contexts can support them to develop more age-inclusive attitudes towards children and youth in daily life. However, this process of raising critical self-awareness related to one’s own adult age can bring up emotional responses e.g., fear, guilt, insecurity, denial etc. that can create obstacles in the learning process of adults and might worsen intergenerational differences.

The central challenge in this course is to propose a game to be used by adults to raise the awareness of the psychological concept of ‘adultcentrism’ among adults in educational relationships with children and youth.

A key ethical question in developing a game for this purpose is whether the design of such a game is age-sensitive towards adult learners.

json195.json,Green Transition in Offshore Wind,"The students will work on one challenge provided by NorSea Group.

A specific method is used in the workshops: Challenge Based Learning (CBL). (CBL) has three distinct phases, Engage, Investigate and Act.

The workshop begins with the **Engage phase**, which moves from the Big Idea (green transition in offshore) to a concrete and actionable challenge by using the essential questioning process (Swiden, 2013).

Once this has been decided upon, participants can then proceed to the **Investigate phase**. Here, participants develop guiding questions to gain the knowledge needed to develop a solution to the challenge. Guiding questions continue to emerge throughout the challenge (Nichols et al., 2016). These could be gathering relevant data for their challenge. A problem-solving technique for this stage such as fishing techniques will also be presented. By these tool participants will understand problems in a more holistic and in-depth way and be enabled to structure their investigations. Participants will then develop their own guiding questions and resources to better understand their challenge. The learnings from this phase provides a foundation for the eventual identification of potential solutions to the challenge (Nichols et al., 2016).

In the **Act phase**, a technique to develop potential solutions will be presented. This includes the ‘six thinking hats’ technique, which encourages each participant to take a different role for developing solutions and help choose the best solution.

a specific method is used in the workshops: challenge based learning (cbl). (cbl) has three distinct phases, engage, investigate and act.

the workshop begins with the **engage phase**, which moves from the big idea (green transition in offshore) to a concrete and actionable challenge by using the essential questioning process (swiden, 2013).

once this has been decided upon, participants can then proceed to the **investigate phase**. here, participants develop guiding questions to gain the knowledge needed to develop a solution to the challenge. guiding questions continue to emerge throughout the challenge (nichols et al., 2016). these could be gathering relevant data for their challenge. a problem-solving technique for this stage such as fishing techniques will also be presented. by these tool participants will understand problems in a more holistic and in-depth way and be enabled to structure their investigations. participants will then develop their own guiding questions and resources to better understand their challenge. the learnings from this phase provides a foundation for the eventual identification of potential solutions to the challenge (nichols et al., 2016).

in the **act phase**, a technique to develop potential solutions will be presented. this includes the ‘six thinking hats’ technique, which encourages each participant to take a different role for developing solutions and help choose the best solution. these roles can include thinking more innovatively, or more cautiously, in a more risk-averse manner or in a more bold and experimental way. this is a key part of cbl as it demonstrates how participants do not have fixed roles and are able to change their roles to have different perspectives on their challenges.

json20.json,Adapting to Climate Change with Spatial Engineering,"The whole world is confronted with the effects of a changing climate. The challenge is how we deal with this situation. So how big is the problem in the city under study? What is at risk, and why? What is being done? What will happen if nothing is done? What would be the effect of adaptation measures?

In this course we follow the conceptual framework on risk defined by IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, www.ipcc.ch), where risk is at the centre. [Figure 1](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/managing-the-risks-of-extreme-events-and-disasters-to-advance-climate-change-adaptation/summary-for-policymakers/spm_fig1/) presents this framework, where three core concepts of weather and climate, exposure and vulnerability interact (IPCC, 2014). The risk of climate-related impacts results from the interaction of climate-related hazards (including weather and climatic events and their trends) with the vulnerability and exposure of human and natural systems. Changes in both the climate system (left) and socioeconomic processes including adaptation and mitigation (right) are drivers for changes in hazard, exposure, and vulnerability (IPCC, 2014).

There are options for risk reduction through adaptation, because adaptation measures can reduce risk by addressing one or more of the three risk factors: vulnerability, exposure, and/or hazard.This can be achieved through various policy and action choices. A visualisation of this process is in [Figure 2.](https://www.ipcc.ch/srocc/chapter/technical-summary/ts-0-introduction/ipcc-srocc-ts_4/) Risk reduction measures through adaptation (Source: IPCC 2019).

Societies all over the world grapple with socio-technical transformations that cause a divide between worldviews, political beliefs, interests, and ways of living. Moreover, we face grand challenges of climate change, inequality, health, and environmental degradation. This course prepares you to take up these challenges proactively and design interventions that co-shape societies for so-called pluriversal futures, in which multiple ways of being, knowing and making can co-exist. You will develop the mindset, knowledge, and skills to help transform - together with regional stakeholders - the social, environmental, and economic system. In this course you will work in a transdisciplinary manner, connect global challenges with local actions, histories with futures, academic with societal perspectives, action with reflection, and critical modes with creative modes of thinking and design.  

**Collaborate, Create, and Lead**

More concretely, this course centers around a real-world challenge-based project. It is partly carried out with the entire group, and partly in small teams. In the context of the project, you will combine a thorough socio-technical and historical analysis of the challenge with a deep understanding of its local context and conduct hands-on co-imagining and co-shaping activities with different representatives from academia, government, industry, and society. These activities allow you to develop advanced design, analysis, and leadership skills. In this course you will learn unique, transdisciplinary methods for framing and analyzing problems and for responsible futuring and prototyping. Together, you will make a difference in society.

**Make an Impact: Real Projects, Real Change**

Activating workshops, intensive coaching sessions, field trips and inspiring guest lectures will support the project.

business modelling in the circular economy is something quite different than in the linear economy. partners, stakeholders, and suppliers all must be taken into consideration when forming an innovative company with a circular business idea. this module covers the foundations of business models and sustainability in the light of business development. then we move into practical exercises where you get to work with circular business models.

**what will you learn?**  

you will explore the intersection between innovative business models and sustainability – two fields that, when combined, can lead to real change. the module focuses on business applications and provides practical skills for working with both physical and digital business ideas. through case studies you will learn by practicing business modelling on real cases.  

**who is this module for?**  

if you are interested in how the circular economy will shape both innovative solutions and business, it does not matter what background you have. this module is designed to be given for students coming from technical, sustainability, or business backgrounds.

**preliminary schedule**

below you see a preliminary schedule for the module. note that the synchronous sessions (in bold) are obligatory . the asynchronous sessions and group work appear in the schedule in specific days every week to give you an idea of how much time you need to invest in the module and how you can structure your studying. you can of course plan your week and studying according to your own needs and schedule.

json51.json,Tackling the Housing Crisis: Strategies for Lowering Rent in urban communities.,"The increase in rental housing prices is a complex phenomenon influenced by a combination of economic, social, and legislative factors:  

Among the economic factors, we can identify a demand that exceeds the supply of housing due to the lack of policies that incentivize and promote the existence of an affordable rental housing stock, as well as the strong interest from investors in investing in the rental property market, which drives prices up. Both factors contribute to rising prices. Additionally, difficulties in obtaining mortgage loans to buy homes can increase the demand for rentals.  

Among the social factors, the high population concentration in cities also contributes, making prices higher in urban areas. In Spain, the prices in cities like Madrid and Barcelona stand out. Changes in family structure, with the increase in single-person households or nuclear families, also play a role. Furthermore, the rise in tourist rentals (such as through platforms like Airbnb) can reduce the supply of housing available for long-term rental, increasing prices.  

Among the legislative factors, regulations that set limitations on the rental price can reduce the incentive for owners to enter the rental market or invest in building maintenance, thus reducing supply. Tax regulations can also affect the rental price, in the event that tax rates are passed on to tenants.

json70.json,From Waste to Worth: Harnessing Excess Summer Heat,"“Vilniaus šilumos tinklai” is the largest central heating company in the Baltic States. The desire to be innovative, efficient, and competitive is inseparable from our daily operations. We constantly rethink our business models, technological solutions, and explore creativeways to utilize our capacities throughout the year.  

One of the key challenges we face today is the efficient utilization of heat during the summer months. Due to seasonality, the demand for heating drops significantly, yet there remains untapped potential. Market conditions, such as the low price of biomass and the availability of waste heat from industrial processes and cooling units, present a unique opportunity: we have the capacity to act, but lack a clear direction for the best use of this excess heat.  

Could the solution lie within our own sector, related industries, or even in entirely new and innovative applications outside the energy domain? Solving this challenge would help us reduce operational seasonality, improve efficiency, and contribute to a more sustainable use of resources.

one of the key challenges we face today is the efficient utilization of heat during the summer months. due to seasonality, the demand for heating drops significantly, yet there remains untapped potential. market conditions, such as the low price of biomass and the availability of waste heat from industrial processes and cooling units, present a unique opportunity: we have the capacity to act, but lack a clear direction for the best use of this excess heat.  

could the solution lie within our own sector, related industries, or even in entirely new and innovative applications outside the energy domain? solving this challenge would help us reduce operational seasonality, improve efficiency, and contribute to a more sustainable use of resources.

json71.json,Advancing Sustainable Futures: Integrating Biogas Production into Society for a Greener Transition,"This challenge examines how Anaerobic Digestion (AD) of organic waste can be used to produce biogas and biofertilizer in order to deal with issues related to energy, climate, agriculture and health. Principles for and applications of anaerobic digestion of organic waste will be covered, as well as opportunities and obstacles for the implementation of biogas technology in various contexts. This iteration of the module focuses on research related challenges of biogas production. The learners will have the opportunity to choose and work on one of four challenges provided by Linköping University researchers working on different aspects of the AD process:

**Challenge 1: Antimicrobial Resistance and Anaerobic Digestion**

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is the ability of microorganisms to resist the effects of drugs that are meant to kill or inhibit them. It can lead to infections that are difficult or impossible to treat, and increase the risk of disease transmission and mortality. One of the main drivers of this is the overuse and misuse of antibiotics in animal farming, as antibiotics pass from animal waste to the environment and affect the microbial communities. Although AD can be an effective method to reduce the environmental impact of animal waste, its impact on AMR is not well understood. In this challenge, learners will have to develop solutions on how an AD system can effectively reduce AMR in animal waste while producing biogas as a renewable energy source. The solutions can combine technical, legislative and policy aspects. 

**Challenge 2: Carbon Capture Utilization and Storage (CCUS)**

During the production of high-quality biogas, CO2 molecules are released into the atmosphere. These emissions are biogenic and considered neutral. However, they can result in less atmospheric CO2 if they are captured at point-sources, and then are either permanently stored (Carbon Capture and Storage - CCS) or used in production (Carbon Captured Utilization). Currently there is a lack of policy and funding instruments globally to promote and facilitate CCS and CCU, that combined are referred to as CCUS. Learners working on this challenge will be tasked to come up with solutions that address the lack of policy and funding for CCUS.      

**Challenge 3: Medium Chain Carboxylic Acids (MCCAs)**

Medium Chain Carboxylic Acids (MCCAs) are valuable chemicals that can be used in various industrial applications, including biofuels, lubricants, and pharmaceuticals. Producing MCCAs from organic waste through AD systems presents a promising opportunity to create value-added products while addressing waste management issues. This challenge encourages learners to develop innovative methods for optimizing MCCA production from AD systems, contributing to the development of a circular bioeconomy and reducing environmental impact. 

**Challenge 4: Nanotechnology and Anaerobic Digestion**

One of the strategies for improving the biogas production process is the use of nanotechnology, though which anaerobic digestion can be stimulated and harmful substances mitigated. However, the presence of nanoparticles, depending on their chemical composition and concentration, can inhibit the AD process. In some cases can even represent a potential environmental threat if the product of AD is used as a biofertilizer. For what is more, the production and addition of nanoparticles can increase the cost of biogas production. In this challenge, learners will have to propose strategy solutions to make the addition of nanoparticles in the AD process cost effective, environmental friendly and safe for the soil. 

Each learner will work on **only one** challenge. Challenges will be allocated based on the learners preferences and the needs of the module.

json81.json,"Developing a Network of Climate Shelters in Toulouse, France","Imagine walking through your city on a scorching summer day, the heat reflecting off buildings and pavements intensifying with every step. This isn't just an inconvenience—it’s a growing reality for urban populations worldwide. Climate change is accelerating the frequency and intensity of heatwaves, and cities are bearing the brunt of it. The urban heat island effect, caused by dense infrastructure and limited green spaces, turns our cities into heat traps, making life increasingly uncomfortable and, for some, dangerously unsafe.

Faced with these challenges, the focus has shifted from simply reducing emissions to actively adapting our urban environments. How can we design cities that protect their inhabitants during extreme heat events? Enter climate shelters—innovative spaces designed to offer immediate relief from thermal stress. These can be public parks shaded by tree canopies, air-conditioned libraries, or cooling stations equipped with water fountains. Climate shelters don’t just address physical discomfort; they represent a shift in urban planning, prioritizing human well-being and resilience.

Cities like Barcelona, Paris, Rotterdam, and Brussels are leading the way, pioneering strategies to integrate climate shelters into their urban fabric. But what makes these solutions effective? And how can other cities adapt these ideas to their unique contexts?

This course invites you to explore these questions, delving into the science of urban microclimates and the art of designing adaptive urban spaces. By understanding the principles behind climate shelters, you'll gain insights into how thoughtful design can transform cities into havens of comfort and sustainability. Whether you're an aspiring architect, urban planner, or simply passionate about resilient cities, this course equips you to be part of the solution to one of our most pressing global challenges. Join us in reimagining urban life for a warming world.

Toulouse, located in the south-west of France, is at the forefront of the urban climate crisis, regularly hitting 40C and above during the summer. As such, Toulouse Métropole has been working in collaboration with local researchers for a number of years in order to initiate its climate transition. As part of this ECIU challenge, students will be invited to consider the potential deployment of a network of climate shelters in the city.

json92.json,I&E Studies,"**Teaching Methods**

A large autonomy is given to the students to organise and achieve their goals.

Students will work in small teams, with each team assigned to a challenge.

Teams will identify and address a challenge/question in the context of their assigned case, such as considering alternate business models or analysing go-to-market scenarios. Students need to ground their reflections by exploring some specific areas: business environment, competition, suppliers, partners, environmental and sustainability issues, etc, both deductively (i.e., through desk research) and inductively (i.e., through field work) as appropriate.

To address their challenge/question, the students will cover the 4 generic steps of an explorative business analysis:

• Identification of the relevant challenge/question,

• Acquisition of applicable concepts/methods/tools,

• Observations (data collection) on a selected part of the case,

• Analysis and interpretation.

Students’ supervision comprises:

• A few group sessions to introduce and detail the assignments, and help students identify the challenges/questions,

• 1-to-many mentoring sessions, where teams will be coached in completing their case study, and progress will be monitored,

• A final oral defence.

Each student will be in charge of a part of the group’s delivery, with specific “roles” defined during the mentoring sessions.

The companies responsible for the case will contribute to supervision, provide data/contacts, participate in the oral defence and/or offer other meeting occasions to ensure rooting of the business assignment in real life.

While the course foresees several (4-5) plenary lectures covering topics that are of general use to all students, most of the time will be dedicated to group mentoring.
