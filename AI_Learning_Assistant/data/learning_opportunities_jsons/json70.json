The desire to be innovative, efficient, and competitive is inseparable from our daily operations. We constantly rethink our business models, technological solutions, and explore creativeways to utilize our capacities throughout the year.  \n\nOne of the key challenges we face today is the efficient utilization of heat during the summer months. Due to seasonality, the demand for heating drops significantly, yet there remains untapped potential. Market conditions, such as the low price of biomass and the availability of waste heat from industrial processes and cooling units, present a unique opportunity: we have the capacity to act, but lack a clear direction for the best use of this excess heat.  \n\nCould the solution lie within our own sector, related industries, or even in entirely new and innovative applications outside the energy domain? Solving this challenge would help us reduce operational seasonality, improve efficiency, and contribute to a more sustainable use of resources.  \n\nOur goal is to discover innovative solutions to effectively utilize excess heat during the summer season. These solutions can range from ideas within the energy sector to creative, cross-industry applications.  \n\nThe energy sector is a field where technological advancement and innovation intersect with sustainability and purpose. The solutions implemented in the sector not only affect companies as economic entities but also have a significant impact on the overall goal of sustainability and a cleaner

The scheduled meetings with the teamchers and the peer learners **will be held once a week on Thursdays**: March 6, 13, 20, 27; April 10, 17, 24; May 8, 22, 29. The meetings will be held **at 15.30-17.00/18.30 EET**(depending on the day). Please note that attendance is mandatory and highly appreciated by your team members.\n\nThe learners are supported by the KTU teamchers (faculty) and the partner company Vilniaus \u0161ilumos tinklai. The learner teams are presented with the challenge during the kick-off meeting, they are invited to do an interim presentation on the progress of their project in the middle of the module and the final presentation of the shallenge solution at the last meeting of the module. The final grade is passed/failed.  \n\nAfter the successful completion of the challenge:\n\n- In two weeks, a student will receive an email with the link to download the ECIU University micro-credential.\n- In mid-June 2025, a student from other university than KTU will receive an email with the KTU Transcript of Records that might be presented for recognition of learning outcomes at the home university.","Subject":{"InScheme":{"Id":"urn:eciu:note","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"ParticipantInformation"},"Id":"4cbaac02-e3f8-4ccd-b80b-45341998684a","Type":"Concept"}}],"HasPart":null,"Id":"urn:eciu:learningActivitySpec:4cbaac02-e3f8-4ccd-b80b-45341998684a","Type":"LearningActivitySpecification"},"BannerImage":null,"MoreInformation":[{"NoteLiteral":"","Subject":{"InScheme":{"Id":"urn:eciu:note","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"SourceIdentifier"},"Id":"4cbaac02-e3f8-4ccd-b80b-45341998684a","Type":"Concept"}},{"NoteLiteral":"What is the best way to use cheap summer surplus heat of district heating?","Subject":{"InScheme":{"Id":"urn:eciu:note","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"SubTitle"},"Id":"4cbaac02-e3f8-4ccd-b80b-45341998684a","Type":"Concept"}},{"NoteLiteral":"Are you ready to drive change in the energy sector? Vilniaus \u0160ilumos Tinklai, a leader in sustainable heating solutions, presents an exciting challenge for visionary thinkers. As the seasons change, so does the demand for district heating. Despite advancements in technology, such as biomass energy and waste heat utilization, summer months still see a significant underuse of production capacities due to low demand.\n\nWe invite you to explore cutting-edge solutions to minimize the impact of seasonality on heat production. Your challenge is to find innovative business models or technological breakthroughs that can harness excess heat during the off-peak summer months. Whether through developing new products, creating energy storage solutions, or repurposing heat for other uses, your ideas can lead to enhanced operational efficiency and reduced costs in the heating sector.\n\nWhy Participate?\n- Your solutions could significantly reduce environmental impact and reshape the energy landscape.\n- Work on a live issue facing the industry and see your ideas potentially implemented.\n- Gain valuable experience in problem-solving, innovation, and sustainability practices.\n\nJoin us in this venture to not only challenge the status quo but also contribute to a more sustainable and efficient future.
