Pointing in a similar direction, the World Economic Forum identifies creative thinking and AI as two essential future skills. This ECIU Challenge creates a learning context in which students in STEM and other areas of study can train these two highly important skills. In order to develop a relevant and sustainable solution to a challenge revolving around creativity in the era of AI, it is necessary to combine insights from different domains and disciplines. The course provides an environment in which the students bring their different disciplinary backgrounds and skills to the table to collaboratively work on such a solution."},"LearningAchievementSpecification":{"EQFLevel":{"InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/snb/eqf/25831c2","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"Level 7"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/snb/eqf/7","Type":"Concept"},"CreditPoint":{"Framework":{"InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/snb/education-credit/25831c2","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"European Credit Transfer System"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/snb/education-credit/6fcec5c5af","Type":"Concept"},"Point":"3,0","Id":"urn:epass:creditPoint:81c5766a-84be-4dc4-859c-6043da7a056b","Type":"CreditPoint"},"LearningOutcome":[{"Title":{"En":"Possibilities and limits of AI"},"RelatedESCOSkill":[{"Notation":"Skill","InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/concept-scheme/skills","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"use ICT systems"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/skill/31d35d3d-2bf2-49aa-9c20-92566ef80277","Type":"Concept"},{"Notation":"Skill","InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/concept-scheme/skills","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"principles of artificial intelligence"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/skill/e465a154-93f7-4973-9ce1-31659fe16dd2","Type":"Concept"}],"AdditionalNote":{"NoteLiteral":{"En":"By the end of the Challenge learners will gain an understanding of key possibilities and limits of AI and its impact on human creativity."},"Id":"urn:eciu:note:cbb6f6c6-5155-ef11-bfe3-000d3a236867","Type":"Note"},"Id":"urn:epass:learningOutcome:81c5766a-84be-4dc4-859c-6043da7a056b-1","Type":"LearningOutcome"},{"Title":{"En":"Soft skills relating to interdisciplinary and international collaboration"},"RelatedESCOSkill":[{"Notation":"Skill","InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/concept-scheme/skills","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"work in teams"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/skill/60c78287-22eb-4103-9c8c-28deaa460da0","Type":"Concept"},{"Notation":"Skill","InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/concept-scheme/skills","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"demonstrate intercultural competence"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/skill/c10d5d87-36cf-42f5-8a12-e560fb5f4af8","Type":"Concept"},{"Notation":"Skill","InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/concept-scheme/skills","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"listening and asking questions"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/skill/S1.7.3","Type":"Concept"}],"AdditionalNote":{"NoteLiteral":{"En":"By the end of the Challenge learners will cultivate soft skills relating to interdisciplinary and international collaboration, critical thinking, communication, ideation, and collective creativity."},"Id":"urn:eciu:note:111224cd-5255-ef11-bfe3-000d3a236867","Type":"Note"},"Id":"urn:epass:learningOutcome:81c5766a-84be-4dc4-859c-6043da7a056b-2","Type":"LearningOutcome"},{"Title":{"En":"Think holistically about creative processes"},"RelatedESCOSkill":[{"Notation":"Skill","InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/concept-scheme/skills","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"think creatively"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/skill/c624c6a3-b0ba-4a31-a296-0d433fe47e41","Type":"Concept"},{"Notation":"Skill","InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/concept-scheme/skills","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"create new concepts"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/skill/f08e2bd6-0366-4948-a670-1f03f130126f","Type":"Concept"},{"Notation":"Skill","InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/concept-scheme/skills","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"think holistically"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/skill/d56e2c2f-3e01-4b76-a7bb-ecb6d430172f","Type":"Concept"}],"AdditionalNote":{"NoteLiteral":{"En":"By the end of the Challenge learners will be able to bridge the gap between theory and practice by applying learned innovation methods to real-world challenges, thereby gaining a practical understanding of the concepts.

For that reason, society is confronted with complex questions such as: Can AI be creative? To what extent does AI impact human creativity? What is creativity in the first place and how does it work? AI affords unforeseen creative possibilities. At the same time, AI raises multifaceted sociotechnical questions, ranging from bias, misinformation, and human-machine interaction harms to mass unemployment and a new human self-understanding. Both exploring the potential of AI-powered creativity and finding solutions to the risks it generates requires experimentation and outside-the-box thinking. The seminar enables the participating students to use their collective creativity to identify a challenge at the intersection of creativity and AI and to collaboratively develop an innovative, interdisciplinary solution. The challenge provides a unique learning environment that empowers the participants to acquire not only a theoretical understanding of, but also practical competencies concerning, AI-driven creativity. Moreover, by interacting with a diverse set of external stakeholders, the students gain insights into different domains and industries.","Subject":{"InScheme":{"Id":"urn:eciu:note","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"Introduction"},"Id":"81c5766a-84be-4dc4-859c-6043da7a056b","Type":"Concept"}},{"NoteLiteral":"True","Subject":{"InScheme":{"Id":"urn:eciu:note","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"GenerateMicroCredentials"},"Id":"81c5766a-84be-4dc4-859c-6043da7a056b","Type":"Concept"}},{"NoteLiteral":"All students with an interest in Creativity and Artificial Intelligence as well as the generation and evaluation of new and useful ideas are very welcome.\n\nQuestions regarding the course itself will be answered by\u00A0jonas.bozenhard@tuhh.de from September 2024.\n\nTo apply for the course a CV and Transcript of Record are needed.\n\nPlease be aware, students who will fail to attend the first session on 14 October without valid excuse will be excluded from the course and will not be able to join the remaining sessions as places are limited.\n\n**For TUHH students:**\u00A0Please note that you can receive TUHH credits for your master\u0027s program only via the corresponding NTA course\u00A0for which you must register at TUHH.
