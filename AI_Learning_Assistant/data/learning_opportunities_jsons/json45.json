Partners, stakeholders, and suppliers all must be taken into consideration when forming an innovative company with a circular business idea. This module covers the foundations of business models and sustainability in the light of business development. Then we move into practical exercises where you get to work with circular business models.\n\n**What will you learn?**  \n\nYou will explore the intersection between innovative business models and sustainability \u2013 two fields that, when combined, can lead to real change. The module focuses on business applications and provides practical skills for working with both physical and digital business ideas. Through case studies you will learn by practicing business modelling on real cases.  \n\n**Who is this module for?**  \n\nIf you are interested in how the circular economy will shape both innovative solutions and business, it does not matter what background you have. This module is designed to be given for students coming from technical, sustainability, or business backgrounds.\n\n**Preliminary schedule**\n\nBelow you see a preliminary schedule for the module. Note that the synchronous sessions (in bold) are obligatory . The asynchronous sessions and group work appear in the schedule in specific days every week to give you an idea of how much time you need to invest in the module and how you can structure your studying. You can of course plan your week and studying according to your own needs and schedule.\n\nWeek 1\n\n**Monday: Welcome lecture and course overview - 2h - synchronous (time TBA)**\n\nTuesday: Innovation lecture -
