Both factors contribute to rising prices. Additionally, difficulties in obtaining mortgage loans to buy homes can increase the demand for rentals.  \n\nAmong the social factors, the high population concentration in cities also contributes, making prices higher in urban areas. In Spain, the prices in cities like Madrid and Barcelona stand out. Changes in family structure, with the increase in single-person households or nuclear families, also play a role. Furthermore, the rise in tourist rentals (such as through platforms like Airbnb) can reduce the supply of housing available for long-term rental, increasing prices.  \n\nAmong the legislative factors, regulations that set limitations on the rental price can reduce the incentive for owners to enter the rental market or invest in building maintenance, thus reducing supply. Tax regulations can also affect the rental price, in the event that tax rates are passed on to tenants.  \n\nDuring this challenge we will try to find out what initiatives, proposals and measures could be taken by local governments to solve this problem in urban communities, starting with the Spanish city council of Terrassa as a pilot"},"LearningAchievementSpecification":{"EQFLevel":{"InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/snb/eqf/25831c2","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"Level 7"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/snb/eqf/7","Type":"Concept"},"CreditPoint":{"Framework":{"InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/snb/education-credit/25831c2","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"European Credit Transfer System"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/snb/education-credit/6fcec5c5af","Type":"Concept"},"Point":"3,0","Id":"urn:epass:creditPoint:766c1fac-26ce-48c0-be47-1d8ccdf1e790","Type":"CreditPoint"},"LearningOutcome":[{"Title":{"En":"Action-Research Design"},"RelatedESCOSkill":[{"Notation":"Skill","InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/concept-scheme/skills","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"think holistically"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/skill/d56e2c2f-3e01-4b76-a7bb-ecb6d430172f","Type":"Concept"}],"AdditionalNote":{"NoteLiteral":{"En":"By the end of the course, the learner is trained on how to design and implement collaborative research with different stakeholders."},"Id":"urn:eciu:note:5c0a55ba-3a4b-ef11-bfe2-00224882b2f6","Type":"Note"},"Id":"urn:epass:learningOutcome:766c1fac-26ce-48c0-be47-1d8ccdf1e790-1","Type":"LearningOutcome"},{"Title":{"En":"Prototype Design"},"RelatedESCOSkill":[{"Notation":"Skill","InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/concept-scheme/skills","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"demonstrate willingness to learn"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/skill/A1.8.0","Type":"Concept"}],"AdditionalNote":{"NoteLiteral":{"En":"By the end of the challenge, the learner is trained on how to translate ideas into specific, action-oriented proposals.
