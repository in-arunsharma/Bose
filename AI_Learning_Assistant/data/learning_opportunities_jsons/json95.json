Therefore, intercultural communication and work in intercultural teams have become essential skills to be acquired due to globalisation and spreading internationalisation. Developing these skills becomes an advantage for a more successful start of a professional career.\n\nIn the micro-module \u201CIntercultural Teamwork\u201D we uncover the features of working together in teams with people from different cultures.\n\nEveryone interested in teamwork and cultural differences is invited to join this course. You do not need to have any specific skills to participate.\n\nAt the end of the micro-module:\n\n1. You will become acquainted with team-working phases and the intercultural differences that influence collaborative decision-making.\n2.
