This isn\u0027t just an inconvenience\u2014it\u2019s a growing reality for urban populations worldwide. Climate change is accelerating the frequency and intensity of heatwaves, and cities are bearing the brunt of it. The urban heat island effect, caused by dense infrastructure and limited green spaces, turns our cities into heat traps, making life increasingly uncomfortable and, for some, dangerously unsafe.\n\nFaced with these challenges, the focus has shifted from simply reducing emissions to actively adapting our urban environments. How can we design cities that protect their inhabitants during extreme heat events? Enter climate shelters\u2014innovative spaces designed to offer immediate relief from thermal stress. These can be public parks shaded by tree canopies, air-conditioned libraries, or cooling stations equipped with water fountains. Climate shelters don\u2019t just address physical discomfort; they represent a shift in urban planning, prioritizing human well-being and resilience.\n\nCities like Barcelona, Paris, Rotterdam, and Brussels are leading the way, pioneering strategies to integrate climate shelters into their urban fabric. But what makes these solutions effective? And how can other cities adapt these ideas to their unique contexts?\n\nThis course invites you to explore these questions, delving into the science of urban microclimates and the art of designing adaptive urban spaces. By understanding the principles behind climate shelters, you\u0027ll gain insights into how thoughtful design can transform cities into havens of comfort and sustainability. Whether you\u0027re an aspiring architect, urban planner, or simply passionate about resilient cities, this course equips you to be part of the solution to one of our most pressing global challenges. Join us in reimagining urban life for a warming world.\n\nToulouse, located in the south-west of France, is at the forefront of the urban climate crisis, regularly hitting 40C and above during the summer. As such, Toulouse M\u00E9tropole has been working in collaboration with local researchers for a number of years in order to initiate its climate transition. As part of this ECIU challenge, students will be invited to consider the potential deployment of a network of climate shelters in the city.\n\nThis work will help students grow skills across a vairety of disciplines including:\n\n- Microclimatology for outdoor climate shelters and the study of the Toulouse climatic context\n- Building thermics and building renovation for indoor climate shelters\n- Energy for the energy supply of HVAC systems\n- Geography and/or sociology for the accessibility of this network\n- Architecture and/or urban planning for the integration of these spaces into a larger urban project"},"LearningAchievementSpecification":{"EQFLevel":{"InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/snb/eqf/25831c2","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"Level 5"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/snb/eqf/5","Type":"Concept"},"CreditPoint":{"Framework":{"InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/snb/education-credit/25831c2","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"European Credit Transfer System"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/snb/education-credit/6fcec5c5af","Type":"Concept"},"Point":"3,0","Id":"urn:epass:creditPoint:471955cd-079a-4f26-843f-55bdc40bbd75","Type":"CreditPoint"},"LearningOutcome":[{"Title":{"En":"Analyse urban microclimates"},"RelatedESCOSkill":[{"Notation":"Skill","InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/concept-scheme/skills","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"conduct research on climate processes"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/skill/442328a8-8a11-4e15-b80c-402a9bd5844d","Type":"Concept"}],"AdditionalNote":{"NoteLiteral":{"En":"By the end of this module, you will be able to analyse the urban microclimate in a public space used as a climate shelter"},"Id":"urn:eciu:note:4e12bc27-3bb6-ef11-b8e8-6045bd9640df","Type":"Note"},"Id":"urn:epass:learningOutcome:471955cd-079a-4f26-843f-55bdc40bbd75-1","Type":"LearningOutcome"},{"Title":{"En":"Evaluate buildings\u0027 thermal behaviour"},"RelatedESCOSkill":[{"Notation":"Skill","InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/concept-scheme/skills","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"create thematic maps"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/skill/9e14c1d8-72f2-45ba-815d-0d12e12d19fa","Type":"Concept"}],"AdditionalNote":{"NoteLiteral":{"En":"By the end of this module, students will be able to create maps to develop a network of adapted and accessible climate shelters"},"Id":"urn:eciu:note:24692c98-3bb6-ef11-b8e8-6045bd9640df","Type":"Note"},"Id":"urn:epass:learningOutcome:471955cd-079a-4f26-843f-55bdc40bbd75-2","Type":"LearningOutcome"},{"Title":{"En":"Create maps"},"RelatedESCOSkill":[{"Notation":"Skill","InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/concept-scheme/skills","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"create 3D texture map"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/skill/be59c6bd-0e88-4ffe-bc81-50b86be815e6","Type":"Concept"}],"AdditionalNote":{"NoteLiteral":{"En":"Evaluate the thermal performance of a building used as a climate shelter\u0022 et remplacer la comp\u00E9tence par \u0022sustainable building design"},"Id":"urn:eciu:note:f4fc9dd5-3bb6-ef11-b8e8-6045bd9640df","Type":"Note"},"Id":"urn:epass:learningOutcome:471955cd-079a-4f26-843f-55bdc40bbd75-3","Type":"LearningOutcome"}],"LearningSetting":null,"Mode":null,"Title":{"En":"Developing a Network of Climate Shelters in Toulouse, France"},"DcType":null,"HomePage":null,"VolumeOfLearning":null,"Id":"urn:eciu:qualification:471955cd-079a-4f26-843f-55bdc40bbd75","Type":"Qualification"},"IsPartOf":{"Mode":null,"DcType":null,"Title":{"En":"Developing a Network of Climate Shelters in Toulouse, France"},"AdmissionsProcedure":null,"ApplicationDeadline":null,"Description":null,"LearningAchievementSpecification":null,"IsPartOf":null,"Temporal":null,"ProvidedBy":null,"LearningActivitySpecification":null,"BannerImage":null,"MoreInformation":[{"NoteLiteral":"INSA Toulouse","Subject":{"InScheme":{"Id":"urn:eciu:note","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"EducationIdentifier"},"Id":"c1a135d4-39b6-ef11-b8e8-6045bd9640df","Type":"Concept"}}],"Id":"urn:eciu:learningOpportunity:c1a135d4-39b6-ef11-b8e8-6045bd9640df","Type":"LearningOpportunity"},"Temporal":{"EndDate":"2025-04-12T00:00:00Z","Name":{"En":"Temporal"},"StartDate":"2025-05-28T00:00:00Z"},"ProvidedBy":{"Location":null,"Logo":null,"LegalName":{"En":"INSTITUT NATIONAL DES SCIENCES APPLIQUEES DE TOULOUSE (INSA TOULOUSE)"},"Registration":null,"Homepage":null,"Id":"urn:eciu:org:bc4a5510-6a54-ed11-bba2-6045bd886566","Type":"Organisation"},"LearningActivitySpecification":{"Mode":null,"DcType":null,"Title":{"En":""},"Description":null,"MoreInformation":[{"NoteLiteral":"The challenge will be held online from April to May 2025.

Today, the focus has shifted from mitigation to adaptation, with a focus on managing rising urban temperatures and their impacts on communities. In this context, climate shelters have emerged as innovative solutions. Either indoor or outdoor spaces, climate shelters offer refuge from extreme heat, providing cooler environments (with or without air conditioning), and are equipped with public amenities like seating and water fountains. Cities such as Barcelona, Paris, Rotterdam, and Brussels have already pioneered climate shelter initiatives, demonstrating their potential to enhance urban resilience in the face of a warming world. As part of this ECIU challenge, you will explore the development of a climate shelter network in Toulouse, one of the hottest cities in France. With summer temperatures frequently exceeding 40\u00B0C, Toulouse is particularly vulnerable to heatwaves and is thus an ideal case study for practical, impactful learning.","Subject":{"InScheme":{"Id":"urn:eciu:note","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"Introduction"},"Id":"471955cd-079a-4f26-843f-55bdc40bbd75","Type":"Concept"}},{"NoteLiteral":"True","Subject":{"InScheme":{"Id":"urn:eciu:note","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"GenerateMicroCredentials"},"Id":"471955cd-079a-4f26-843f-55bdc40bbd75","Type":"Concept"}},{"NoteLiteral":"This challenge is open to Master\u0027s students in the following disciplines: civil engineering, building thermics, urban planning, geography, sociology, atmospheric physics and architecture.\n\nApplications must be submitted by 12/02/2025 and should include a covering letter, CV, and transcript of records.","Subject":{"InScheme":{"Id":"urn:eciu:note","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"AdmissionProcessInformation"},"Id":"471955cd-079a-4f26-843f-55bdc40bbd75","Type":"Concept"}},{"NoteLiteral":"False","Subject":{"InScheme":{"Id":"urn:eciu:note","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"SimplifiedAdmissionProcess"},"Id":"471955cd-079a-4f26-843f-55bdc40bbd75","Type":"Concept"}},{"NoteLiteral":"2024-12-19","Subject":{"InScheme":{"Id":"urn:eciu:note","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"ApplicationPeriodStartDate"},"Id":"471955cd-079a-4f26-843f-55bdc40bbd75","Type":"Concept"}},{"NoteLiteral":"12","Subject":{"InScheme":{"Id":"urn:eciu:note","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"MaximumNumberOfSeats"},"Id":"471955cd-079a-4f26-843f-55bdc40bbd75","Type":"Concept"}},{"NoteLiteral":"False","Subject":{"InScheme":{"Id":"urn:eciu:note","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"ECIULMSENabled"},"Id":"471955cd-079a-4f26-843f-55bdc40bbd75","Type":"Concept"}},{"NoteLiteral":"","Subject":{"InScheme":{"Id":"urn:eciu:note","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"LMSUrl"},"Id":"471955cd-079a-4f26-843f-55bdc40bbd75","Type":"Concept"}},{"NoteLiteral":"","Subject":{"InScheme":{"Id":"urn:eciu:note","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"TeamAccessDate"},"Id":"471955cd-079a-4f26-843f-55bdc40bbd75","Type":"Concept"}},{"NoteLiteral":"false","Subject":{"InScheme":{"Id":"urn:eciu:note","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"SelfPaced"},"Id":"471955cd-079a-4f26-843f-55bdc40bbd75","Type":"Concept"}},{"NoteLiteral":"0","Subject":{"InScheme":{"Id":"urn:eciu:note","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"Pace"},"Id":"471955cd-079a-4f26-843f-55bdc40bbd75","Type":"Concept"}},{"NoteLiteral":"Standard","Subject":{"InScheme":{"Id":"urn:eciu:note","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"Scope"},"Id":"471955cd-079a-4f26-843f-55bdc40bbd75","Type":"Concept"}}],"Id":"urn:eciu:learningOpportunity:471955cd-079a-4f26-843f-55bdc40bbd75","Type":"LearningOpportunity"}
