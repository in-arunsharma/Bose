Questions of what requirements and standards we should hold technology to, and why. What kind of agents are artificial systems, and can they be considered moral agents? Can they be ascribed any moral responsibility at all? And where should the main responsibility for artificial intelligence (AI) be placed and why?\n\nThe micro-module focuses on three main areas of moral relevance for autonomous systems and AI:\n\n1. Responsibility for decisions made by artificial agents.\n2. Bias/discrimination as a result of AI use.\n3. The importance of participation in the development of AI systems.\n\nDuring this micro-module, students are provided theoretical tools for reflection on the development of AI, requirements that ought to be made regarding this technology and how it ought to be managed in society."},"LearningAchievementSpecification":{"EQFLevel":{"InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/snb/eqf/25831c2","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"Level
