The micro-module is intended to develop an understanding of the basic structure of mechanical parts of machines, i.e. how motion is obtained in machines. If we are concerned about mobility, or the system that allows motion, we see the core component in it \u2013 a machine that performs mechanical motion. The micro-module presents an overview of the main types of mechanisms used in machinery, their kinematical and load capacity properties. Special focus is made on gear mechanisms developing abilities to calculate the necessary power to get the desired motion under loads caused by it, select the mechanism structure, to analyze motion parameters."},"LearningAchievementSpecification":{"EQFLevel":{"InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/snb/eqf/25831c2","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"Level 7"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/snb/eqf/7","Type":"Concept"},"CreditPoint":{"Framework":{"InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/snb/education-credit/25831c2","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"European Credit Transfer System"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/snb/education-credit/6fcec5c5af","Type":"Concept"},"Point":"1,0","Id":"urn:epass:creditPoint:c62bdcc7-23bd-ef11-b8e8-7c1e525dc572","Type":"CreditPoint"},"LearningOutcome":[{"Title":{"En":"Basic gear mechanisms"},"RelatedESCOSkill":[{"Notation":"Skill","InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/concept-scheme/skills","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"solve problems"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/skill/adc6dc11-3376-467b-96c5-9b0a21edc869","Type":"Concept"}],"AdditionalNote":{"NoteLiteral":{"En":"To determine the basic functional properties of gear mechanisms."},"Id":"urn:eciu:note:dbd29cd1-23bd-ef11-b8e8-6045bd89e10e","Type":"Note"},"Id":"urn:epass:learningOutcome:c62bdcc7-23bd-ef11-b8e8-7c1e525dc572-1","Type":"LearningOutcome"},{"Title":{"En":"Functional properties of mechanisms"},"RelatedESCOSkill":[{"Notation":"Skill","InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/concept-scheme/skills","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"develop innovative mobility solutions"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/skill/fcffe2a5-6253-4848-92e7-749304aca647","Type":"Concept"}],"AdditionalNote":{"NoteLiteral":{"En":"To characterise functional properties of linkages, gear and cam mechanisms in machines and devices and represent their structure schematically by kinematical symbols."},"Id":"urn:eciu:note:bf417cc7-23bd-ef11-b8e8-6045bd8e221f","Type":"Note"},"Id":"urn:epass:learningOutcome:c62bdcc7-23bd-ef11-b8e8-7c1e525dc572-2","Type":"LearningOutcome"},{"Title":{"En":"Machines for solution of engineering problems"},"RelatedESCOSkill":[{"Notation":"Skill","InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/concept-scheme/skills","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"use IT tools"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/skill/f632251a-4078-4546-b19f-7ef528d08325","Type":"Concept"}],"AdditionalNote":{"NoteLiteral":{"En":"To discuss feasibility of the application of mechanisms with certain properties for solution of engineering problems."},"Id":"urn:eciu:note:56425dce-23bd-ef11-b8e8-6045bd927338","Type":"Note"},"Id":"urn:epass:learningOutcome:c62bdcc7-23bd-ef11-b8e8-7c1e525dc572-3","Type":"LearningOutcome"}],"LearningSetting":null,"Mode":null,"Title":{"En":"Basics of Machinery Mechanics"},"DcType":null,"HomePage":null,"VolumeOfLearning":null,"Id":"urn:eciu:qualification:c62bdcc7-23bd-ef11-b8e8-7c1e525dc572","Type":"Qualification"},"IsPartOf":{"Mode":null,"DcType":null,"Title":{"En":"Basics\u00A0of\u00A0Machinery\u00A0Mechanics\u200B"},"AdmissionsProcedure":null,"ApplicationDeadline":null,"Description":null,"LearningAchievementSpecification":null,"IsPartOf":null,"Temporal":null,"ProvidedBy":null,"LearningActivitySpecification":null,"BannerImage":null,"MoreInformation":null,"Id":"urn:eciu:learningOpportunity:8b73b70c-211d-ef11-840a-000d3a2a7e23","Type":"LearningOpportunity"},"Temporal":{"EndDate":"2025-03-17T00:00:00Z","Name":{"En":"Temporal"},"StartDate":"2025-04-18T00:00:00Z"},"ProvidedBy":{"Location":null,"Logo":null,"LegalName":{"En":"KAUNO TECHNOLOGIJOS UNIVERSITETAS (KTU)"},"Registration":null,"Homepage":null,"Id":"urn:eciu:org:4cc1e316-6a54-ed11-bba2-6045bd886566","Type":"Organisation"},"LearningActivitySpecification":{"Mode":null,"DcType":null,"Title":{"En":""},"Description":{"En":"[https://uais.cr.ktu.lt/ktuis/stp_report_ects.mdl_ml?p_kodas=MM00M118\u0026p_year=2024\u0026p_lang=EN\u0026p_stp_id=](https://uais.cr.ktu.lt/ktuis/stp_report_ects.mdl_ml?p_kodas=MM00M118\u0026amp;p_year=2024\u0026amp;p_lang=EN\u0026amp;p_stp_id=)"},"MoreInformation":[{"NoteLiteral":"This micro-module is intended for learners of technological sciences with no background in mechanical engineering or learners in social sciences, humanities, natural or health sciences.
