As early as 2019, we set ambitious environmental goals. Later, in 2023, we aimed to achieve net-zero targets by 2040. Achieving these goals is impossible without new business models, innovations, digitization, and a net-zero supply chain.\n\nOnly 5 years are left for the mid-term goal implementation: to reduce value chain emissions by half. We have to find new solutions or change our business in order to reach these goals. Use your bright thoughts, knowledge in technologies, IoT, and digitalization, and harness your potential for a better future for all of us and future

There are also other issues related to the extensive use of equipment for networks, CPE equipment, and a large number of electronic devices.  Electricity, energy production and usage, equipment and electronic device manufacturing, as well as service provision, emit a huge amount of GHGs, which cause climate change.\nAlthough emissions related to the extraction of resources, production, and transportation of purchased equipment are not directly associated with Telia activities, they are counted as indirect emissions of the Telia. Currently, the largest portion of Telia emissions consists of indirect emissions. In 2023, such emissions accounted for a staggering 97%. The largest portion of indirect emissions from the company is comprised of mobile phones and other CPE equipment  for clients, as well as network equipment, along with all associated construction and maintenance work.\nDespite the organization\u0027s efforts to renew customer CPE equipment, accept old equipment from customers, and solely use electricity from renewable sources, as well as implementing various other solutions, achieving a net-zero target throughout the value chain remains a significant challenge. It\u0027s widely acknowledged that without collaboration with stakeholders, reducing value chain emissions is unattainable, and such decisions are crucially linked with service innovations. \nWhat future telecommunication services would require what type of equipment or not? What would future client expectations be? This is the ultimate goal we are trying to project. What net-zero solutions could be suggested? \nPlease be brave and project vividly, and be part of a huge and powerful transformation where all the world\u0027s businesses are focusing on in the face of climate change.","Subject":{"InScheme":{"Id":"urn:eciu:note","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"Introduction"},"Id":"4f9da1c1-23fe-40ab-8a21-114c39c8814d","Type":"Concept"}},{"NoteLiteral":"True","Subject":{"InScheme":{"Id":"urn:eciu:note","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"GenerateMicroCredentials"},"Id":"4f9da1c1-23fe-40ab-8a21-114c39c8814d","Type":"Concept"}},{"NoteLiteral":"**Entry requirements:**\n\n- at least 90 ECTS completed at the undergraduate level;\n- B2 level of English language proficiency.\n\n**Documents to be submitted in English:**\n\n- motivation letter - personal motivation to join the challenge, attitude towards experimenting and trying out new educational models, previous experience on the challenge topic;\n- transcript of records - proof of enrolment in a Bachelor\u0027s or Master\u2019s degree programme in one of the 13 ECIU university members, stating that completed at least 90 ECTS at the undergraduate level, and the study field/programme; not mandatory for KTU students;\n- copy of ID card/passport in \u0022other\u0022 - a document issued by the country of origin (needed for registration to university services); not mandatory for KTU students.\n\nPlease note that documents submitted not in English will not be processed further in the admission process.","Subject":{"InScheme":{"Id":"urn:eciu:note","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"AdmissionProcessInformation"},"Id":"4f9da1c1-23fe-40ab-8a21-114c39c8814d","Type":"Concept"}},{"NoteLiteral":"False","Subject":{"InScheme":{"Id":"urn:eciu:note","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"SimplifiedAdmissionProcess"},"Id":"4f9da1c1-23fe-40ab-8a21-114c39c8814d","Type":"Concept"}},{"NoteLiteral":"2024-06-15","Subject":{"InScheme":{"Id":"urn:eciu:note","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"ApplicationPeriodStartDate"},"Id":"4f9da1c1-23fe-40ab-8a21-114c39c8814d","Type":"Concept"}},{"NoteLiteral":"15","Subject":{"InScheme":{"Id":"urn:eciu:note","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"MaximumNumberOfSeats"},"Id":"4f9da1c1-23fe-40ab-8a21-114c39c8814d","Type":"Concept"}},{"NoteLiteral":"False","Subject":{"InScheme":{"Id":"urn:eciu:note","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"ECIULMSENabled"},"Id":"4f9da1c1-23fe-40ab-8a21-114c39c8814d","Type":"Concept"}},{"NoteLiteral":"","Subject":{"InScheme":{"Id":"urn:eciu:note","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"LMSUrl"},"Id":"4f9da1c1-23fe-40ab-8a21-114c39c8814d","Type":"Concept"}},{"NoteLiteral":"","Subject":{"InScheme":{"Id":"urn:eciu:note","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"TeamAccessDate"},"Id":"4f9da1c1-23fe-40ab-8a21-114c39c8814d","Type":"Concept"}},{"NoteLiteral":"false","Subject":{"InScheme":{"Id":"urn:eciu:note","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"SelfPaced"},"Id":"4f9da1c1-23fe-40ab-8a21-114c39c8814d","Type":"Concept"}},{"NoteLiteral":"0","Subject":{"InScheme":{"Id":"urn:eciu:note","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"Pace"},"Id":"4f9da1c1-23fe-40ab-8a21-114c39c8814d","Type":"Concept"}},{"NoteLiteral":"Standard","Subject":{"InScheme":{"Id":"urn:eciu:note","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"Scope"},"Id":"4f9da1c1-23fe-40ab-8a21-114c39c8814d","Type":"Concept"}}],"Id":"urn:eciu:learningOpportunity:4f9da1c1-23fe-40ab-8a21-114c39c8814d","Type":"LearningOpportunity"}
