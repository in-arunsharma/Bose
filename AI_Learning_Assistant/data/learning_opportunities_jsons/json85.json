We must actively focus on equipping our children with knowledge, critical thinking, problem-solving skills, creativity, and emotional intelligence. These skills will help them process and understand the vast amounts of information they encounter and enable them to adapt, thrive, and lead in this dynamic and challenging century.\n\nThis course is designed to enrich students\u0027 knowledge and skills so they can use mathematics as a tool to support and develop children\u0027s thinking abilities. Through a combination of theory and practical application, students will learn to integrate mathematical concepts in engaging and meaningful ways, thereby enhancing children\u0027s analytical abilities, problem-solving competence, and critical thinking. This will ultimately contribute to green transition by equipping children with the tools to make thoughtful choices regarding sustainable alternatives for the community.\u00A0\n\nThis course has as one of its unique features the fact that it is developed entirely within a kindergarten, where theory and practice will be in constant exchange. The theoretical instructors from UiS and the kindergarten teachers from Sande Barnehage will be partners in leading the course."},"LearningAchievementSpecification":{"EQFLevel":{"InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/snb/eqf/25831c2","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"Level 7"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/snb/eqf/7","Type":"Concept"},"CreditPoint":{"Framework":{"InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/snb/education-credit/25831c2","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"European Credit Transfer System"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/snb/education-credit/6fcec5c5af","Type":"Concept"},"Point":"5,0","Id":"urn:epass:creditPoint:92254c1c-efce-419f-91ee-5b451294ce94","Type":"CreditPoint"},"LearningOutcome":[{"Title":{"En":"Knowledge"},"RelatedESCOSkill":[{"Notation":"Skill","InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/concept-scheme/skills","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"solve problems"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/skill/adc6dc11-3376-467b-96c5-9b0a21edc869","Type":"Concept"},{"Notation":"Skill","InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/concept-scheme/skills","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"listen actively"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/skill/a17286c5-238d-4f0b-bc24-29e9121345de","Type":"Concept"},{"Notation":"Skill","InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/concept-scheme/skills","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"listening and asking questions"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/skill/S1.7.3","Type":"Concept"},{"Notation":"Skill","InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/concept-scheme/skills","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"communicate using non-verbal language"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/skill/8813bf9b-86f3-47d1-849d-399121e6d429","Type":"Concept"},{"Notation":"Skill","InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/concept-scheme/skills","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"body language"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/skill/1a59af95-f36a-4d99-a5ca-6a7a46e2ecb0","Type":"Concept"}],"AdditionalNote":{"NoteLiteral":{"En":"Students will have advanced knowledge of concepts such as: Critical thinking, problem-solving, practice-based deep learning, embodied education, and children\u0027s participation;
