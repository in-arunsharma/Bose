Bringing digital technologies and sustainability goals together is logical, and necessary, and today Digital Twins are already having a radical impact on sustainability. By its nature, digital technologies are adaptable and responsive to innovation \u2013 but technology providers do not have a monopoly on ideas. This challenge seeks new ideas, and original thinking, to apply Digital Twin technologies to sustainability goals.  \n\n**Digital Twins**  \n\nDigital twins are virtual counterparts of tangible assets, providing real-time data, optimisation, predictive analytics, and alerts. The significance of DT isn\u0027t confined to engineers or facility managers, it\u0027s equally valuable for end-users and property owners. A pivotal area where digital twin technology shows promise is in real-time sustainability monitoring.  \n\nDigital Twins can significantly improve the design, construction, and operation of assets of all types. It can improve efficiency by monitoring performance in real time, including carbon outputs. It is envisaged that Digital Twins should simulate entire systems or interlinked assets to simulate future effects of climate or citizen actions. They should enable society to do more with less, to utilise resources better, longer, and to recycle where replacement has been the norm, to align engineering data with reality, geospatial, IOT and other operational data. By means of IoT data, Digital Twins should allow AI and machine learning to better analyse performance and improve efficiency.  \n\nIf the above is true \u2013 what are the opportunities yet unseen, what has not been envisaged, and where are the next true innovations? Recognising that there is often doubt and scepticism when innovation challenges long-held thinking, submissions should consider how societies can facilitate those who would otherwise be sceptical to be part of that change as data proliferation increasingly becomes more widespread and more important to the goals of optimal sustainability."},"LearningAchievementSpecification":{"EQFLevel":{"InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/snb/eqf/25831c2","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"Level

In the European Union (EU), buildings account for 40% of energy consumption and contribute to 36% of greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, construction and demolition waste make up over one-third of all waste generated in the EU. As Europe strives to achieve climate neutrality by 2050, the emphasis on intelligent construction and management becomes paramount. This is where Digital Twin (DT) technology, which offers high potential, comes into play. It aids in tracking, optimising, and predicting the performance of buildings and infrastructure.\n\nDuring the challenge, student teams are expected to:\n\u2022\tcreate a methodology for including sustainability indicators within urban digital twins, and develop the assessment and visualisation technique for sustainability monitoring - it can be centred around energy, mobility, facilities management, human health and comfort, democratic data governance, waste management, citizen participation and many other domains; \n\u2022\tdevelop mock-ups and protocols (by those with high problem-solving and social science skills) or applications (by those with high IT skills) to showcase the innovation;\n\u2022\tuse real-world case studies from Dublin (Ireland) and Kaunas (Lithuania);\n\u2022\tproduce a poster and a short video, highlighting their key findings and the proposed solution.","Subject":{"InScheme":{"Id":"urn:eciu:note","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"Introduction"},"Id":"a85ccbca-b509-47ab-adf0-be0cd694850c","Type":"Concept"}},{"NoteLiteral":"True","Subject":{"InScheme":{"Id":"urn:eciu:note","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"GenerateMicroCredentials"},"Id":"a85ccbca-b509-47ab-adf0-be0cd694850c","Type":"Concept"}},{"NoteLiteral":"**Entry requirements:**\n\n- at least 90 ECTS completed at the undergraduate level;\n- student of the following fields \u2013 built environment (architecture, civil engineering), mechanical, transportation, data analytics, social sciences and humanities, economy and finance, information and communication technologies;\n- B2 level of English language proficiency.\n\n**Documents to be submitted in English:**\n\n- transcript of records - a proof of enrolment in a Bachelor\u0027s or Master\u2019s degree programme in one of the 13 ECIU university members, stating that completed at least 90 ECTS at the undergraduate level, and the study field/programme;\n- motivation letter - personal motivation to join the challenge, attitude towards experimenting and trying out new educational models, previous experience on the challenge topic;\n\n- copy of ID card/passport in \u0022other\u0022 - a document issued by the country of origin (needed for registration to university services).\n\nPlease note that documents submitted not in the English language will not be processed further in the admission process.","Subject":{"InScheme":{"Id":"urn:eciu:note","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"AdmissionProcessInformation"},"Id":"a85ccbca-b509-47ab-adf0-be0cd694850c","Type":"Concept"}},{"NoteLiteral":"False","Subject":{"InScheme":{"Id":"urn:eciu:note","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"SimplifiedAdmissionProcess"},"Id":"a85ccbca-b509-47ab-adf0-be0cd694850c","Type":"Concept"}},{"NoteLiteral":"2024-06-01","Subject":{"InScheme":{"Id":"urn:eciu:note","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"ApplicationPeriodStartDate"},"Id":"a85ccbca-b509-47ab-adf0-be0cd694850c","Type":"Concept"}},{"NoteLiteral":"15","Subject":{"InScheme":{"Id":"urn:eciu:note","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"MaximumNumberOfSeats"},"Id":"a85ccbca-b509-47ab-adf0-be0cd694850c","Type":"Concept"}},{"NoteLiteral":"False","Subject":{"InScheme":{"Id":"urn:eciu:note","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"ECIULMSENabled"},"Id":"a85ccbca-b509-47ab-adf0-be0cd694850c","Type":"Concept"}},{"NoteLiteral":"","Subject":{"InScheme":{"Id":"urn:eciu:note","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"LMSUrl"},"Id":"a85ccbca-b509-47ab-adf0-be0cd694850c","Type":"Concept"}},{"NoteLiteral":"","Subject":{"InScheme":{"Id":"urn:eciu:note","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"TeamAccessDate"},"Id":"a85ccbca-b509-47ab-adf0-be0cd694850c","Type":"Concept"}},{"NoteLiteral":"false","Subject":{"InScheme":{"Id":"urn:eciu:note","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"SelfPaced"},"Id":"a85ccbca-b509-47ab-adf0-be0cd694850c","Type":"Concept"}},{"NoteLiteral":"0","Subject":{"InScheme":{"Id":"urn:eciu:note","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"Pace"},"Id":"a85ccbca-b509-47ab-adf0-be0cd694850c","Type":"Concept"}},{"NoteLiteral":"Standard","Subject":{"InScheme":{"Id":"urn:eciu:note","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"Scope"},"Id":"a85ccbca-b509-47ab-adf0-be0cd694850c","Type":"Concept"}}],"Id":"urn:eciu:learningOpportunity:a85ccbca-b509-47ab-adf0-be0cd694850c","Type":"LearningOpportunity"}
