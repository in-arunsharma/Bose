This micro-module, Introduction to Biomaterials, provides a clear and accessible pathway to understanding inorganic biomaterials and their applications in medicine. Whether you are a student of engineering, medicine, or another related field, this course offers an opportunity to explore how materials science contributes to solving real-world medical challenges.\n\nThe micro-module focuses on key concepts, including the structure, properties, and applications of inorganic biomaterials such as metals, ceramics, and polymers. You will learn how these materials interact with the human body and how they are used in medical devices, implants, and emerging technologies like nanomedicine. Over six weeks, we will guide you step-by-step through topics like biomaterial classification, their physical and chemical properties, and the factors influencing their compatibility with living tissues.\n\nOur goal is to provide you with the knowledge and skills needed to evaluate biomaterials for specific applications. By completing this course, you will gain practical experience in selecting and analysing materials, understanding their limitations, and exploring future developments in the field.\n\nThis micro-module connects scientific principles with healthcare solutions. By joining, you will build a solid foundation that can help you in academic studies or professional practice. Be part of a learning experience that equips you to contribute to advancements in medical technology and to make a difference in people\u2019s lives."},"LearningAchievementSpecification":{"EQFLevel":{"InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/snb/eqf/25831c2","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"Level
