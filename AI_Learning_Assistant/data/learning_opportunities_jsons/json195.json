Here, participants develop guiding questions to gain the knowledge needed to develop a solution to the challenge. Guiding questions continue to emerge throughout the challenge (Nichols et al., 2016). These could be gathering relevant data for their challenge. A problem-solving technique for this stage such as fishing techniques will also be presented. By these tool participants will understand problems in a more holistic and in-depth way and be enabled to structure their investigations. Participants will then develop their own guiding questions and resources to better understand their challenge. The learnings from this phase provides a foundation for the eventual identification of potential solutions to the challenge (Nichols et al., 2016).\n\nIn the **Act phase**, a technique to develop potential solutions will be presented. This includes the \u2018six thinking hats\u2019 technique, which encourages each participant to take a different role for developing solutions and help choose the best solution. These roles can include thinking more innovatively, or more cautiously, in a more risk-averse manner or in a more bold and experimental way. This is a key\u00A0part of CBL as it demonstrates how participants do not have fixed roles and are able to change their roles to have different perspectives on their challenges.\n\nSolutions should be evidence-based and implemented with an \u2018authentic\u2019 (real-life) audience. They should evaluate the effectiveness of the solution and make adjustments, which will deepen their subject area knowledge (Nichols et al., 2016). Within each of the phases there are opportunities for mini-investigation cycles and, if necessary, a return to an earlier phase."},"LearningAchievementSpecification":{"EQFLevel":{"InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/snb/eqf/25831c2","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"Level
