Therefore, the circular economy is inherently cross-sectoral and requires engagement with stakeholders across value chains in pursuit of innovations that contribute to resilient and low-carbon local economies.  \n\nThis societal challenge requires a broad set of skills that is currently lacking in our increasingly specialized society and education. It is therefore crucial that learners at all levels learn to collaborate, to solve ill-structured, complex problems that they get confronted with, by dividing them into smaller, doable tasks. Being able to create criteria and come to fact based decisions is one of the most valuable future skills.  \n\nIn this particular challenge, TUHH together with HiiCCE Hamburg Institute of Innovations in Climate protection and Circular Economy GmbH\u00A0and the interreg project https://www.interregnorthsea.eu/ceo\u00A0are taking a closer look on the transition of the office furniture sector towards a circular economy, integrating financial aspects and business cases. As in the office furniture sector many resources are still being wasted and new office furniture is usually not designed for reuse, repair, refurbishment or recycling. At the same time, the way we work is changing rapidly and constantly and requires office furniture that is modular, adaptable and recyclable. Considering financial aspects and business cases in the context of this challenge is essential for creating sustainable solutions that are economically viable. Learners will explore how sustainable practices can reduce costs. They will investigate how modular and adaptable furniture can extend product lifecycles, reducing the need for frequent replacements and lowering overall expenditures.  \n\nWe are inviting learners to engage on particular, self-chosen aspects to approach the economic aspects of this challenge, always taking into account their individual interests and ideas."},"LearningAchievementSpecification":{"EQFLevel":{"InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/snb/eqf/25831c2","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"Level 7"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/snb/eqf/7","Type":"Concept"},"CreditPoint":{"Framework":{"InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/snb/education-credit/25831c2","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"European Credit Transfer System"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/snb/education-credit/6fcec5c5af","Type":"Concept"},"Point":"3,0","Id":"urn:epass:creditPoint:995b4a9e-521f-4113-87be-441f5ffa2b17","Type":"CreditPoint"},"LearningOutcome":[{"Title":{"En":"Work in international, interdisciplinary teams"},"RelatedESCOSkill":[{"Notation":"Skill","InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/concept-scheme/skills","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"work in teams"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/skill/60c78287-22eb-4103-9c8c-28deaa460da0","Type":"Concept"}],"AdditionalNote":{"NoteLiteral":{"En":"By the end of the course students learn how to work in international, interdisciplinary teams in terms of: knowing about the different roles, reflect on team dynamics, get to know tools for efficient online collaboration and how to provide constructive peer-feedback."},"Id":"urn:eciu:note:405ec32c-ba53-ef11-bfe3-000d3a2d9789","Type":"Note"},"Id":"urn:epass:learningOutcome:995b4a9e-521f-4113-87be-441f5ffa2b17-1","Type":"LearningOutcome"},{"Title":{"En":"Being able to critically reflect on circularity and climate neutrality at an advanced level"},"RelatedESCOSkill":[{"Notation":"Skill","InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/concept-scheme/skills","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"identify new recycling opportunities"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/skill/89f5fa96-ae45-4906-902c-d50ca51009c6","Type":"Concept"},{"Notation":"Skill","InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/concept-scheme/skills","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"promote responsible consumer behaviour"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/skill/e1da04bb-4de8-4d17-af8a-75ea893fe36a","Type":"Concept"},{"Notation":"Skill","InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/concept-scheme/skills","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"adopt ways to reduce negative impact of consumption"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/skill/4c3ab565-747c-4db3-8c47-79e8d6f98cf4","Type":"Concept"},{"Notation":"Skill","InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/concept-scheme/skills","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"show entrepreneurial spirit"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/skill/bdcf429c-5ccf-4c3d-bb61-4c987573a35e","Type":"Concept"}],"AdditionalNote":{"NoteLiteral":{"En":"By the end of the course students will have basic knowledge about the topic Circular Economy and the state of the art in this research field.
