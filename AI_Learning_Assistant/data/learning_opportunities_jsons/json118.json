However, due to the scarcity of point-based weather observations, our understanding of the Earth\u2019s changing climate is very limited. This impedes the advancement in our knowledge of the Earth\u2019s climate system and our capability to develop well-suited climate models to simulate future climate change, which further results in considerable uncertainties associated with future climate projections. How to quantify and minimize these uncertainties is thus becoming one of the most challenging issues to be addressed for climate change impact assessment and adaptation studies. Remote sensing offers a new way of observing the Earth\u2019s climate system with continuous and high-resolution spatial coverage through satellite-based, aircraft-based, or drone-based sensor technologies. This can significantly improve our understanding of climate change and its potential impacts at global, regional, and local scales. The data collected with remote sensing technologies can also be used to validate our climate models, improve our knowledge of the physical and dynamical processes of the climate system, and help us to project future climate change and its impacts with minimized uncertainties.\n\nWhen it comes to the term\u2019s sensors and research, you have to look very closely at what it is all about in the end. From the Smart Sensors department, research focuses on the sensor systems themselves, while at the same time sensors are an important component in various multidisciplinary research activities. In this Challenge, that is embedded in a course for Master students of Microelectronics and Microsystems the relevant aspects in interdisciplinary sensor research will be taught and explored together.\n\nThe Challenge aims to plan a mission for a small satellite that is actually capable of flight and that is built in one of the TUHH\u0027s Bachelor\u0027s programme. As a starting point we will explore the capabilities of fluorescence sensing. Vegetation fluorescence that can reflect photosynthetic activity and plant health and stress. In turn, this is not only important for a better understanding of the global carbon cycle, but also for agricultural management and food security."},"LearningAchievementSpecification":{"EQFLevel":{"InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/snb/eqf/25831c2","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"Level 7"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/snb/eqf/7","Type":"Concept"},"CreditPoint":{"Framework":{"InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/snb/education-credit/25831c2","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"European Credit Transfer System"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/snb/education-credit/6fcec5c5af","Type":"Concept"},"Point":"6,0","Id":"urn:epass:creditPoint:04a4fc44-63e4-47bb-a6bf-750f635f418d","Type":"CreditPoint"},"LearningOutcome":[{"Title":{"En":"Work in international, interdisciplinary teams"},"RelatedESCOSkill":[{"Notation":"Skill","InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/concept-scheme/skills","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"work in teams"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/skill/60c78287-22eb-4103-9c8c-28deaa460da0","Type":"Concept"}],"AdditionalNote":{"NoteLiteral":{"En":"By the end of the course students learn how to work in international, interdisciplinary teams in terms of: knowing about the different roles, reflect on team dynamics, get to know tools for efficient online collaboration and how to provide constructive peer-feedback."},"Id":"urn:eciu:note:eec6b67c-7e6e-ef11-a670-6045bd93476f","Type":"Note"},"Id":"urn:epass:learningOutcome:04a4fc44-63e4-47bb-a6bf-750f635f418d-1","Type":"LearningOutcome"},{"Title":{"En":"Improve knowledge about the technical aspects of sensor system"},"RelatedESCOSkill":[{"Notation":"Skill","InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/concept-scheme/skills","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"use remote control equipment"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/skill/58c3ed60-c06b-47c0-b213-4e3608608644","Type":"Concept"},{"Notation":"Skill","InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/concept-scheme/skills","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"use reservoir surveillance"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/skill/91aade3a-9427-4e80-998b-29492dcb9ffd","Type":"Concept"}],"AdditionalNote":{"NoteLiteral":{"En":"By the end of the course students will have improved their knowledge about technical aspects of sensor systems and based on their basic knowledge explored new technical solutions to the needs."},"Id":"urn:eciu:note:5ff6b013-836e-ef11-a670-6045bd93476f","Type":"Note"},"Id":"urn:epass:learningOutcome:04a4fc44-63e4-47bb-a6bf-750f635f418d-2","Type":"LearningOutcome"},{"Title":{"En":"Improve knowledge of the physical and dynamical processes of the climate system"},"RelatedESCOSkill":[{"Notation":"Skill","InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/concept-scheme/skills","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"climate change impact"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/skill/1565b401-1754-4b07-8f1a-eb5869e64d95","Type":"Concept"}],"AdditionalNote":{"NoteLiteral":{"En":"By the end of the course students will be able to explore how data collected with remote sensing technologies can also be used to improve our knowledge of the physical and dynamical processes of the climate system."},"Id":"urn:eciu:note:072a09e1-846e-ef11-a670-6045bd93476f","Type":"Note"},"Id":"urn:epass:learningOutcome:04a4fc44-63e4-47bb-a6bf-750f635f418d-3","Type":"LearningOutcome"}],"LearningSetting":null,"Mode":null,"Title":{"En":"Facing Climate Change with remote sensing"},"DcType":null,"HomePage":null,"VolumeOfLearning":null,"Id":"urn:eciu:qualification:04a4fc44-63e4-47bb-a6bf-750f635f418d","Type":"Qualification"},"IsPartOf":{"Mode":null,"DcType":null,"Title":{"En":"Facing Climate Change with remote sensing"},"AdmissionsProcedure":null,"ApplicationDeadline":null,"Description":null,"LearningAchievementSpecification":null,"IsPartOf":null,"Temporal":null,"ProvidedBy":null,"LearningActivitySpecification":null,"BannerImage":null,"MoreInformation":null,"Id":"urn:eciu:learningOpportunity:3db1cefb-f069-ef11-bfe2-00224884d34a","Type":"LearningOpportunity"},"Temporal":{"EndDate":"2024-10-14T00:00:00Z","Name":{"En":"Temporal"},"StartDate":"2025-01-20T00:00:00Z"},"ProvidedBy":{"Location":null,"Logo":null,"LegalName":{"En":"TECHNISCHE UNIVERSITAT HAMBURG (TUHH"},"Registration":null,"Homepage":null,"Id":"urn:eciu:org:d2f87009-6a54-ed11-bba2-6045bd886566","Type":"Organisation"},"LearningActivitySpecification":{"Mode":null,"DcType":null,"Title":{"En":""},"Description":null,"MoreInformation":[{"NoteLiteral":"We will have weekly online meetings**each Monday 8-11 am (CET).** The Challenges finish with online team reflection meetings Jan 20th 2025 8-11 am (CET).
