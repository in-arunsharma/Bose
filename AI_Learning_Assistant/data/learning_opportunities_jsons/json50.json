Format**\n\nThis training module is based on participatory workshops and autonomous student work. It comprises 7 workshops with some autonomous work and 1 evaluation session. Outside class time, online activities will favour intercultural interactions between the students. The sessions will be held in hybrid mode: on-site at INSA Toulouse on Mondays from 2pm to 5pm (CET) and online for remote students. The sessions should preferably be followed synchronously on Mondays from 2pm to 5pm (CET), but can be followed online asynchronously during the same week, except for the last two sessions, which need to take place synchronously due to group work. However, for these last two sessions, the schedule can be arranged between the students in the same team and the teacher\n\n**Detailed programme**\n\nThe content will be delivered iteratively, meaning that students will revisit and reinforce previously learned techniques while integrating new ones, thus allowing for continuous improvement and deeper understanding. Most of the activities will be based on group work on different types of written documents, and will also include some oral communication activities in the different languages. Outside class time, online activities will be planned to favour intercultural interactions between the students.\n\n- **October 07 (2-5pm) / possibly asynchronous:**Introductory session: Presentation of the micromodule, introduction to the principles of intercomprehension and first practice exercises in groups\n- **October 14 (2-5pm) / possibly asynchronous:** Workshop 1 (possibly asynchronous): Introduction to the \u201CSeven Sieves\u201D (Klein, H.
