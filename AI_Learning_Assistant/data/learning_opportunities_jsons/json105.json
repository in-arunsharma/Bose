Emerging technologies, such as AI, IoT, and blockchain, have not only accelerated the pace of innovation but have also altered the fundamental approaches to bringing products and services to market. In the recent past, traditional strategies often followed a linear path, where companies meticulously planned product development, market entry, and scaling processes. Today, with the advent of disruptive technologies, this linear approach is no longer sufficient. Instead, we witness a more dynamic, agile, and customer-centric approach.\n\nOne significant change is the speed of adaptation. Disruptive technologies require companies to swiftly pivot and experiment with their strategies. They encourage a \u0027fail-fast\u0027 mentality, where iterations and learning from mistakes are integral to success. Moreover, data-driven decision-making is now at the core of modern go-to-market strategies. The rise of digital platforms and e-commerce has also transformed the reach and accessibility of markets. Companies can now tap into global audiences with minimal physical presence. This shift is forcing traditional brick-and-mortar businesses to reimagine their models.\n\nThe target audience for this micro-module primarily includes individuals such as students, researchers, and entrepreneurs who possess backgrounds outside of business administration or business development. This micro-module is particularly well-suited for those with engineering backgrounds, but it is equally open to individuals from natural and social sciences. Disruptive innovations often find applications across various fields, making this micro-module relevant and beneficial for a wide range of professionals."},"LearningAchievementSpecification":{"EQFLevel":{"InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/snb/eqf/25831c2","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"Level
