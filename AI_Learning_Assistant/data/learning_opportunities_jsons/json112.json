The ultimate goal is to integrate and apply this knowledge in identifying and solving real problems in the area through the implementation of multicultural working groups. During this challenge, priority will be given to innovative and experimental teaching models, such as challenge-based in a blended learning approach that combines virtual and face-to-face mobility\n\n## Impact\n\nThe participants will develop cross-cutting and transdisciplinary knowledge in reproductive health lifestyle.\u00A0This challenge will also promote new forms of international mobility that allow an increase in the number of individuals with an international mobility experience in higher education, while also promoting collaborative and cooperative work skills through the experience of active teaching and learning methodologies. This intensive blended program is aligned with the strategic development plan of the Department of Medical Sciences, within the scope of its internationalization policy, as well as with the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations, namely for Good Health and Well-being (Goal 3), Quality Education (Goal 4), Gender Equality (Goal 5), and Reduced Inequalities (Goal 10)."},"LearningAchievementSpecification":{"EQFLevel":{"InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/snb/eqf/25831c2","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"Level 6"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/snb/eqf/6","Type":"Concept"},"CreditPoint":{"Framework":{"InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/snb/education-credit/25831c2","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"European Credit Transfer System"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/snb/education-credit/6fcec5c5af","Type":"Concept"},"Point":"3,0","Id":"urn:epass:creditPoint:0c1e0060-87db-45a3-b741-6c3be98325d4","Type":"CreditPoint"},"LearningOutcome":[{"Title":{"En":"Identify the lifestyle factors that can have impact on reproductive health"},"RelatedESCOSkill":[{"Notation":"Skill","InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/concept-scheme/skills","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"raise awareness on local community\u0027s priorities"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/skill/7e13a05c-e40d-4970-b285-3d58ecfa627f","Type":"Concept"}],"AdditionalNote":null,"Id":"urn:epass:learningOutcome:0c1e0060-87db-45a3-b741-6c3be98325d4-1","Type":"LearningOutcome"},{"Title":{"En":"Resolve real cases related to the influence of lifestyle on reproductive health"},"RelatedESCOSkill":[{"Notation":"Skill","InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/concept-scheme/skills","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"think creatively"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/skill/c624c6a3-b0ba-4a31-a296-0d433fe47e41","Type":"Concept"}],"AdditionalNote":null,"Id":"urn:epass:learningOutcome:0c1e0060-87db-45a3-b741-6c3be98325d4-2","Type":"LearningOutcome"},{"Title":{"En":"Be able to apply knowledge to human fertility, its control and evaluation"},"RelatedESCOSkill":[{"Notation":"Skill","InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/concept-scheme/skills","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"assist community"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/skill/fb26857b-1f50-4a30-889d-abb599ffece9","Type":"Concept"}],"AdditionalNote":null,"Id":"urn:epass:learningOutcome:0c1e0060-87db-45a3-b741-6c3be98325d4-3","Type":"LearningOutcome"},{"Title":{"En":"Recognise the physiopathological basis of the human reproductive system"},"RelatedESCOSkill":[{"Notation":"Skill","InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/concept-scheme/skills","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"assist community"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/skill/fb26857b-1f50-4a30-889d-abb599ffece9","Type":"Concept"}],"AdditionalNote":null,"Id":"urn:epass:learningOutcome:0c1e0060-87db-45a3-b741-6c3be98325d4-4","Type":"LearningOutcome"}],"LearningSetting":null,"Mode":null,"Title":{"En":"Lifestyle Influence on Reproductive Health"},"DcType":null,"HomePage":null,"VolumeOfLearning":"PT0H","Id":"urn:eciu:qualification:0c1e0060-87db-45a3-b741-6c3be98325d4","Type":"Qualification"},"IsPartOf":{"Mode":null,"DcType":null,"Title":{"En":"Lifestyle Influence on Reproductive Health"},"AdmissionsProcedure":null,"ApplicationDeadline":null,"Description":null,"LearningAchievementSpecification":null,"IsPartOf":null,"Temporal":null,"ProvidedBy":null,"LearningActivitySpecification":null,"BannerImage":null,"MoreInformation":[{"NoteLiteral":"UAV","Subject":{"InScheme":{"Id":"urn:eciu:note","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"EducationIdentifier"},"Id":"36872071-08dd-ed11-a7c6-6045bd886566","Type":"Concept"}}],"Id":"urn:eciu:learningOpportunity:36872071-08dd-ed11-a7c6-6045bd886566","Type":"LearningOpportunity"},"Temporal":{"EndDate":"2024-05-21T00:00:00Z","Name":{"En":"Temporal"},"StartDate":"2024-09-20T00:00:00Z"},"ProvidedBy":{"Location":null,"Logo":null,"LegalName":{"En":"UNIVERSIDADE DE AVEIRO (UAVR)"},"Registration":null,"Homepage":null,"Id":"urn:eciu:org:bde53b3e-6a54-ed11-bba2-6045bd886566","Type":"Organisation"},"LearningActivitySpecification":{"Mode":null,"DcType":null,"Title":{"En":""},"Description":null,"MoreInformation":[{"NoteLiteral":"## Work methods\n\nThis Challenge has the format of an ERASMUS\u002B Blended Intensive Programme. Work takes place in interdisciplinary teams. Total workload of 81 hours, of which 36 hours are contact hours (4 days online and 5 days face-to-face). Evaluation is based on a final presentation of a project resulting from the virtual component in multicultural groups, taking place on the closing event in the form of a pitch. It will be complemented with the analysis of the results of the practical component of the face-to-face component. Therefore, the assessment process will include an individual reflection and peer review (25%) and a presentation and oral discussion of group work (75%).\n\n## When?\n\nThe challenge will be run from May to September 2024 [Online: 21 May; 25 June; 2 July and 13 September 2024; Face-to-face (Aveiro, Portugal): 16-20 September 2024].  \n\n## Intensive Programme in Aveiro, Portugal\n\nFrom 16-20 September 2024 all participants are invited to spend a week at the University of Aveiro campus in Portugal. The event is an integral part of the programme and therefore is not optional.\u00A0  \n\nSince this is an Erasmus\u002B Blended Intensive Programme, participants from ECIU may be eligible for an ERASMUS\u002B grant. Alternatively, the ECIU has set up a mobility fund to contribute to travel and accommodation of participants in ECIU courses and events. For both cases, please contact the ECIU mobility officers for details of the procedures to **apply for a mobility grant for this ECIU Challenge by using the Contact Us form** you will find at the bottom of this page. Just choose the option \u0022I have a question on mobility support\u0022 and ask our team what you need to do. Don\u0027t worry, your request will be directed to a mobility officer located at your University and you will be contacted with the information you need.  \n\nSuccessful candidates will also receive full details of travel and accommodation arrangements for the intensive programme on the first day of the online course.","Subject":{"InScheme":{"Id":"urn:eciu:note","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"ParticipantInformation"},"Id":"0c1e0060-87db-45a3-b741-6c3be98325d4","Type":"Concept"}}],"HasPart":null,"Id":"urn:eciu:learningActivitySpec:0c1e0060-87db-45a3-b741-6c3be98325d4","Type":"LearningActivitySpecification"},"BannerImage":null,"MoreInformation":[{"NoteLiteral":"","Subject":{"InScheme":{"Id":"urn:eciu:note","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"SourceIdentifier"},"Id":"0c1e0060-87db-45a3-b741-6c3be98325d4","Type":"Concept"}},{"NoteLiteral":"","Subject":{"InScheme":{"Id":"urn:eciu:note","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"SubTitle"},"Id":"0c1e0060-87db-45a3-b741-6c3be98325d4","Type":"Concept"}},{"NoteLiteral":"This challenges seeks to find solutions for different lifestyle choices that can shape and influence how people all over the world can manage their reproductive health.","Subject":{"InScheme":{"Id":"urn:eciu:note","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"Introduction"},"Id":"0c1e0060-87db-45a3-b741-6c3be98325d4","Type":"Concept"}},{"NoteLiteral":"True","Subject":{"InScheme":{"Id":"urn:eciu:note","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"GenerateMicroCredentials"},"Id":"0c1e0060-87db-45a3-b741-6c3be98325d4","Type":"Concept"}},{"NoteLiteral":"## Applications\n\nThis challenge is open for undergraduate, master\u0027s, and doctoral students, in the areas of Health, Economics, Management and Education, and other related, within the platform as usual.
