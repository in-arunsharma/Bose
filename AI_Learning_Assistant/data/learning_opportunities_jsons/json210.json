This means you get to gain knowledge from experts of all these different universities! This is therefore a unique opportunity that offers multiple perspectives and an intercultural experience.\n\n### **Why learning about interculturality matters**\n\nInterculturality is a crucial skill in today\u2019s globalized world, enabling effective communication and collaboration across cultural boundaries. It fosters empathy, helps navigate differences with respect, and is essential for addressing global challenges like climate change and migration. In academic and professional settings, intercultural competence is highly valued, supporting teamwork in diverse and international contexts. Personally, it enriches your worldview, enhances self-awareness, and opens you to new perspectives. By embracing interculturality, you contribute to a more inclusive and collaborative global society.\n\n### **What you\u0027ll learn**\n\nThis online micro-module is designed to give you a comprehensive understanding of interculturality through a structured blend of expert-led lectures and interactive discussions. The course is divided into three thematic blocks, each building on the previous one to create a cohesive learning experience:\n\n**Block 1: Understanding cultural differences**  \n\nYou\u2019ll start by exploring foundational theories of culture, learning what defines and distinguishes cultures around the world. This block highlights the importance of cultural diversity in today\u2019s globalized world, helping you develop an awareness of how cultural differences shape interactions and perceptions.\n\n**Block 2: Global perspectives**  \n\nIn this section, you\u2019ll examine the effects of migration, media representation, and the concept of global Englishes. These topics will give you a broader perspective on how cultural narratives evolve and influence societies across the globe. You\u2019ll gain insights into how these factors contribute to both challenges and opportunities in intercultural communication.\n\n**Block 3: Practical intercultural skills**  \n\nThe final block focuses on practical workshops to equip you with effective communication techniques for interacting across cultures. You\u2019ll learn how to navigate cultural nuances in professional and personal settings, ensuring your interactions are respectful, clear, and impactful.\n\nBy the end of the course, you\u2019ll have a deeper understanding of cultural theories, a global perspective on societal changes, and the practical tools to engage effectively in intercultural settings. This combination of theoretical and hands-on learning prepares you to adapt in diverse environments and address the complexities of global communication"},"LearningAchievementSpecification":{"EQFLevel":{"InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/snb/eqf/25831c2","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"Level 6"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/snb/eqf/6","Type":"Concept"},"CreditPoint":{"Framework":{"InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/snb/education-credit/25831c2","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"European Credit Transfer System"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/snb/education-credit/6fcec5c5af","Type":"Concept"},"Point":"1,0","Id":"urn:epass:creditPoint:a05f94cd-829d-451c-b61c-fc1ead662d94","Type":"CreditPoint"},"LearningOutcome":[{"Title":{"En":"Theoretical frameworks of interculturality"},"RelatedESCOSkill":[{"Notation":"Skill","InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/concept-scheme/skills","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"demonstrate intercultural competence"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/skill/c10d5d87-36cf-42f5-8a12-e560fb5f4af8","Type":"Concept"}],"AdditionalNote":{"NoteLiteral":{"En":"Describe, discuss and compare theoretical frameworks of interculturality"},"Id":"urn:eciu:note:4407ae9c-f8b2-ef11-b8e8-6045bd8e221f","Type":"Note"},"Id":"urn:epass:learningOutcome:a05f94cd-829d-451c-b61c-fc1ead662d94-1","Type":"LearningOutcome"},{"Title":{"En":"Apply and demonstrate theoretical concepts of interculturality"},"RelatedESCOSkill":[{"Notation":"Skill","InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/concept-scheme/skills","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"demonstrate intercultural competence"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/skill/c10d5d87-36cf-42f5-8a12-e560fb5f4af8","Type":"Concept"},{"Notation":"Skill","InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/concept-scheme/skills","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"respect the diversity of cultural values and norms"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/skill/5ca953f7-541d-4f67-bc55-7721348366cf","Type":"Concept"},{"Notation":"Skill","InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/concept-scheme/skills","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"think holistically"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/skill/d56e2c2f-3e01-4b76-a7bb-ecb6d430172f","Type":"Concept"}],"AdditionalNote":{"NoteLiteral":{"En":"Apply theoretical concepts of interculturality to analyze real-world scenarios or personal experiences, demonstrating an understanding of how cultural perspectives influence interactions and relationships"},"Id":"urn:eciu:note:cf3fabcd-f8b2-ef11-b8e8-6045bd8e221f","Type":"Note"},"Id":"urn:epass:learningOutcome:a05f94cd-829d-451c-b61c-fc1ead662d94-2","Type":"LearningOutcome"},{"Title":{"En":"Contribute to discussions on interculturality"},"RelatedESCOSkill":[{"Notation":"Skill","InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/concept-scheme/skills","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"listening and asking questions"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/skill/S1.7.3","Type":"Concept"},{"Notation":"Skill","InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/concept-scheme/skills","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"show intercultural awareness"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/skill/7d23c508-c007-4221-bb84-0c9a479b8ea6","Type":"Concept"}],"AdditionalNote":{"NoteLiteral":{"En":"Contribute informed insights to discussions on interculturality, drawing on relevant theories and personal perspectives"},"Id":"urn:eciu:note:8a3f6de0-f8b2-ef11-b8e8-6045bd8e221f","Type":"Note"},"Id":"urn:epass:learningOutcome:a05f94cd-829d-451c-b61c-fc1ead662d94-3","Type":"LearningOutcome"}],"LearningSetting":null,"Mode":null,"Title":{"En":"Introduction to Interculturality"},"DcType":null,"HomePage":null,"VolumeOfLearning":"PT0H","Id":"urn:eciu:qualification:a05f94cd-829d-451c-b61c-fc1ead662d94","Type":"Qualification"},"IsPartOf":{"Mode":null,"DcType":null,"Title":{"En":"Introduction to Interculturality"},"AdmissionsProcedure":null,"ApplicationDeadline":null,"Description":null,"LearningAchievementSpecification":null,"IsPartOf":null,"Temporal":null,"ProvidedBy":null,"LearningActivitySpecification":null,"BannerImage":null,"MoreInformation":null,"Id":"urn:eciu:learningOpportunity:b7ac9769-6497-ef11-8a6a-000d3aa85bba","Type":"LearningOpportunity"},"Temporal":{"EndDate":"2025-03-17T00:00:00Z","Name":{"En":"Temporal"},"StartDate":"2025-06-13T00:00:00Z"},"ProvidedBy":{"Location":null,"Logo":null,"LegalName":{"En":"UNIVERSITEIT TWENTE (UT)"},"Registration":null,"Homepage":null,"Id":"urn:eciu:org:813e9d57-6a54-ed11-bba2-6045bd886566","Type":"Organisation"},"LearningActivitySpecification":{"Mode":null,"DcType":null,"Title":{"En":""},"Description":null,"MoreInformation":[{"NoteLiteral":"### Learning Activities:\n\n- Online micro-lectures (self-study)\n- Online discussions\n- Small assignments\n\n### **Learning Schedule:**\n\nThis micro-module is completely online.
