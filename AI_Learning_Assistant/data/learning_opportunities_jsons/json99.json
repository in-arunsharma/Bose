Winter no longer means your bicycle gathers dust. With innovative technology and creative minds, we envision a future where bicycles are not just for outdoor adventures but also for enhancing indoor experiences. This challenge seeks bright ideas for technological and software systems that transform a standard bicycle for indoor use, making cycling an engaging, game-like activity regardless of the weather outside.\nParticipants will embark on creating a system that not only allows a bicycle to be used indoors but also turns pedaling into an interactive, gamified experience. By connecting the bike to a stationary setup, your efforts will bring to life a visual or game-like adventure on screen, where the speed and intensity of pedaling steer the journey. This initiative is not just about innovation; it\u0027s a step towards sustainable living and wellness, offering students the chance to make a tangible impact while honing their skills in technology and creativity. Join us in redefining cycling and be part of the movement that keeps the wheels turning, come rain, snow, or shine.","Subject":{"InScheme":{"Id":"urn:eciu:note","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"Introduction"},"Id":"ea0d549c-5f29-ef11-840a-6045bd9b587d","Type":"Concept"}},{"NoteLiteral":"True","Subject":{"InScheme":{"Id":"urn:eciu:note","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"GenerateMicroCredentials"},"Id":"ea0d549c-5f29-ef11-840a-6045bd9b587d","Type":"Concept"}},{"NoteLiteral":"**Entry requirements:**\n\n- at least 90 ECTS completed at the undergraduate level;\n- B2 level of English language proficiency.\n\n**Documents to be submitted:**\n\n- motivation letter - personal motivation to join the challenge, attitude towards experimenting and trying out new educational models, previous experience on the challenge topic;\n- transcript of records - proof of enrolment in a Bachelor\u0027s or Master\u2019s degree programme in one of the 13 ECIU university members, stating that completed at least 90 ECTS at the undergraduate level, and the study field/programme; not mandatory for KTU students;\n- copy of ID card/passport in \u0022other\u0022 - a document issued by the country of origin (needed for registration to university services); not mandatory for KTU students.\n\nPlease note that documents submitted not in English will not be processed further in the admission process.","Subject":{"InScheme":{"Id":"urn:eciu:note","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"AdmissionProcessInformation"},"Id":"ea0d549c-5f29-ef11-840a-6045bd9b587d","Type":"Concept"}},{"NoteLiteral":"False","Subject":{"InScheme":{"Id":"urn:eciu:note","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"SimplifiedAdmissionProcess"},"Id":"ea0d549c-5f29-ef11-840a-6045bd9b587d","Type":"Concept"}},{"NoteLiteral":"2024-06-15","Subject":{"InScheme":{"Id":"urn:eciu:note","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"ApplicationPeriodStartDate"},"Id":"ea0d549c-5f29-ef11-840a-6045bd9b587d","Type":"Concept"}},{"NoteLiteral":"15","Subject":{"InScheme":{"Id":"urn:eciu:note","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"MaximumNumberOfSeats"},"Id":"ea0d549c-5f29-ef11-840a-6045bd9b587d","Type":"Concept"}},{"NoteLiteral":"False","Subject":{"InScheme":{"Id":"urn:eciu:note","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"ECIULMSENabled"},"Id":"ea0d549c-5f29-ef11-840a-6045bd9b587d","Type":"Concept"}},{"NoteLiteral":"","Subject":{"InScheme":{"Id":"urn:eciu:note","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"LMSUrl"},"Id":"ea0d549c-5f29-ef11-840a-6045bd9b587d","Type":"Concept"}},{"NoteLiteral":"","Subject":{"InScheme":{"Id":"urn:eciu:note","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"TeamAccessDate"},"Id":"ea0d549c-5f29-ef11-840a-6045bd9b587d","Type":"Concept"}},{"NoteLiteral":"false","Subject":{"InScheme":{"Id":"urn:eciu:note","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"SelfPaced"},"Id":"ea0d549c-5f29-ef11-840a-6045bd9b587d","Type":"Concept"}},{"NoteLiteral":"0","Subject":{"InScheme":{"Id":"urn:eciu:note","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"Pace"},"Id":"ea0d549c-5f29-ef11-840a-6045bd9b587d","Type":"Concept"}},{"NoteLiteral":"Standard","Subject":{"InScheme":{"Id":"urn:eciu:note","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"Scope"},"Id":"ea0d549c-5f29-ef11-840a-6045bd9b587d","Type":"Concept"}}],"Id":"urn:eciu:learningOpportunity:ea0d549c-5f29-ef11-840a-6045bd9b587d","Type":"LearningOpportunity"}
