The growing interest in air quality has led to the recognition of odours as atmospheric pollutants, considering their negative impact to the surrounding environment and population. However, there is no consensus considering odour pollution, no guidelines and no instrument to objectively give a value or a scale of odour nuisance. Consequently, the ways to manage odours are still very heterogeneous at the European level. Atmo Normandie, an air quality observatory in Normandy, is a forerunner in odour recognition and evaluation. Working with Atmo Normandie in Rouen, a metropolis at 1h15 by train from Paris, challenge participants will research the integration of this olfactory aspect into the more global issue of air pollution in their home regions in order to understand to what extent it is integrated by the population in their home territories.","Subject":{"InScheme":{"Id":"urn:eciu:note","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"Introduction"},"Id":"d7669792-46b8-44af-84d2-a0b484988bec","Type":"Concept"}},{"NoteLiteral":"True","Subject":{"InScheme":{"Id":"urn:eciu:note","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"GenerateMicroCredentials"},"Id":"d7669792-46b8-44af-84d2-a0b484988bec","Type":"Concept"}},{"NoteLiteral":"To be eligible for this challenge, you should currently be studying for a Masters.\n\nTo apply, please upload:\n\n- a CV\n\n- a detailed motivation letter, indicating why the applicant is interested in this kind of project, what are the added values of the applicants to this CBL and what are the previous experiences of the applicant in this domain (if any)\n\n- a copy of ID card/passport in \u0022other\u0022 document\n\nThere are no explicit domain prerequisites, but an open attitude towards wicked problems, interdisciplinary team work and international competences are required\n\nApplications are opened to all fields like management, geography, law, socio-psychology, political sciences, ecology, engineering, data science.\n\nA particular care will be done for the selection process to have a large panel of students coming from different domains, from different universities, and above all not only from the domain of engineering.\n\nRegarding financial support for your mobility, please consult your home university.
