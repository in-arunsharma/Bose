It encompasses the technical, legal, and ethical aspects of implementing self-driving delivery systems in cities. Additionally, it addresses the question of how to encourage businesses, companies, and private individuals to adopt and utilize this service.\n\nThe challenge involves developing a robust framework that ensures the safe and efficient operation of these robots while gaining public trust and acceptance. This includes overcoming hurdles related to navigation, obstacle avoidance, and real-time decision-making in dynamic city settings, as well as addressing regulatory compliance and ethical considerations.\n\n**About the challenge provider:**\n\nDyno Robotics strives to create robots and AI solutions that make people\u0027s lives better. We are based in Link\u00F6ping, Sweden, and we have our roots at Link\u00F6ping University. Having spent many years at the robotics labs inventing things, we saw that there were many great technologies that were slow to reach the market. Therefore, we founded Dyno Robotics in 2018. The core of Dyno Robotics consists of people who love turning complex technology into valuable solutions and engaging experiences."},"LearningAchievementSpecification":{"EQFLevel":{"InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/snb/eqf/25831c2","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"Level 6"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/snb/eqf/6","Type":"Concept"},"CreditPoint":{"Framework":{"InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/snb/education-credit/25831c2","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"European Credit Transfer System"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/snb/education-credit/6fcec5c5af","Type":"Concept"},"Point":"8,0","Id":"urn:epass:creditPoint:83f1ad0c-baaa-4ed2-8c00-7825757cd4cc","Type":"CreditPoint"},"LearningOutcome":[{"Title":{"En":"Communication and presentation"},"RelatedESCOSkill":[{"Notation":"Skill","InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/concept-scheme/skills","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"promote ideas, products, services"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/skill/df5e3d02-9f0f-44ee-91c2-85c62f161868","Type":"Concept"},{"Notation":"Skill","InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/concept-scheme/skills","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"communicate using non-verbal language"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/skill/8813bf9b-86f3-47d1-849d-399121e6d429","Type":"Concept"},{"Notation":"Skill","InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/concept-scheme/skills","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"demonstrate intercultural competence"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/skill/c10d5d87-36cf-42f5-8a12-e560fb5f4af8","Type":"Concept"}],"AdditionalNote":{"NoteLiteral":{"En":"Orally and in writing communicate solutions to parties with different backgrounds and domain knowledge.
