Remarkably, 98% of these were triggered by climate-related hazards as documented by the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre.\u00A0\n\nIn fact, 84% of refugees and asylum seekers in 2022 fled from countries highly vulnerable to climate change, marking a 61% increase compared to 2010. Most people forced to flee their homes move within their own countries, but international migrations are increasingly common.\u00A0\n\nCurrently, the right to asylum due to the effects of climate change is not yet recognized, unlike protection for those escaping war conflicts, as defined during the 1951 Geneva Convention. \u00A0This lack of recognition, coupled with the complex and multi-causal nature of migration reasons, makes it challenging to assess how much climate change is influencing new international migration trends and its role as a decisive factor.\u00A0\n\nWith this challenge, we aim to demonstrate/quantify the existence of forced displacements due to climate change, to provide consistency and contribute to the debate surrounding climate change migration."},"LearningAchievementSpecification":{"EQFLevel":{"InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/snb/eqf/25831c2","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"Level 7"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/snb/eqf/7","Type":"Concept"},"CreditPoint":{"Framework":{"InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/snb/education-credit/25831c2","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"European Credit Transfer System"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/snb/education-credit/6fcec5c5af","Type":"Concept"},"Point":"3,0","Id":"urn:epass:creditPoint:39a44a36-f2e4-484d-bb7b-ff3db155b3a8","Type":"CreditPoint"},"LearningOutcome":[{"Title":{"En":"Action-Research Design"},"RelatedESCOSkill":[{"Notation":"Skill","InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/concept-scheme/skills","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"think innovately"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/skill/c2a0c52c-0b4b-4180-a918-92650ea3b458","Type":"Concept"},{"Notation":"Skill","InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/concept-scheme/skills","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"think holistically"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/skill/d56e2c2f-3e01-4b76-a7bb-ecb6d430172f","Type":"Concept"}],"AdditionalNote":{"NoteLiteral":{"En":"By the end of the course, the learner is trained on how to design and implement collaborative research with different stakeholders."},"Id":"urn:eciu:note:e802a0da-4b4b-ef11-bfe2-00224882b2f6","Type":"Note"},"Id":"urn:epass:learningOutcome:39a44a36-f2e4-484d-bb7b-ff3db155b3a8-1","Type":"LearningOutcome"},{"Title":{"En":"Prototype Design"},"RelatedESCOSkill":[{"Notation":"Skill","InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/concept-scheme/skills","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"demonstrate willingness to learn"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/skill/A1.8.0","Type":"Concept"}],"AdditionalNote":{"NoteLiteral":{"En":"By the end of the challenge, the learner is trained on how to translate ideas into specific, action-oriented proposals."},"Id":"urn:eciu:note:8dc99c82-4c4b-ef11-bfe2-00224882b2f6","Type":"Note"},"Id":"urn:epass:learningOutcome:39a44a36-f2e4-484d-bb7b-ff3db155b3a8-2","Type":"LearningOutcome"},{"Title":{"En":"Autonomous Learning"},"RelatedESCOSkill":[{"Notation":"Skill","InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/concept-scheme/skills","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"solve problems"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/skill/adc6dc11-3376-467b-96c5-9b0a21edc869","Type":"Concept"}],"AdditionalNote":{"NoteLiteral":{"En":"By the end of the course, the student is trained on how to set their own learning goals and determine the resources and methods needed to achieve them.

This issue is quite complex, requiring more detailed information, particularly regarding migrations driven by extractive practices such as mining and those prompted by slow-onset climate changes, such as gradually rising sea levels, which make certain areas uninhabitable over time. These migrations frequently exacerbate global inequalities, as the individuals who suffer the most are often not the ones responsible for the environmental problems. Our aim is not only to raise awareness about these forced migrations but also to develop a better understanding of and solutions for addressing them.","Subject":{"InScheme":{"Id":"urn:eciu:note","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"Introduction"},"Id":"39a44a36-f2e4-484d-bb7b-ff3db155b3a8","Type":"Concept"}},{"NoteLiteral":"True","Subject":{"InScheme":{"Id":"urn:eciu:note","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"GenerateMicroCredentials"},"Id":"39a44a36-f2e4-484d-bb7b-ff3db155b3a8","Type":"Concept"}},{"NoteLiteral":"**Entry requirements:**\n\n- at least 90 ECTS completed at the undergraduate level;\n\n- B2 level of English language proficiency.\n\n**Documents to be submitted in English:**\n\n- recent cv\n\n- motivation letter - personal motivation to join the challenge, attitude towards experimenting and trying out new educational models, previous experience on the challenge topic.\n\n- transcript of records - proof of enrolment in a Bachelor\u0027s or Master\u2019s degree programme in one of the 13 ECIU university members, stating that completed at least 90 ECTS at the undergraduate level, and the study field/programme.\n\n- copy of ID card/passport in \u0022other\u0022 - a document issued by the country of origin (needed for registration to university services\n\n**Acceptance notification:**\n\n- Students will be notified about their application status no later than 5 days after the application deadline.\n- \\*\\*IMPORTANT:\\*\\*This learning oportunity contains 5 days of on-site training at Universitat Aut\u00F2noma de Barcelona.\u00A0Since this is an Erasmus\u002B Blended Intensive Programme, participants from ECIU University may be eligible for an ERASMUS\u002B grant.
