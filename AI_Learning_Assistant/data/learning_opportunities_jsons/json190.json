Adultcentric bias can create barriers in recognizing the capacities of children and youth to contribute to society as they can be pre-judged to be \u2018incompetent\u2019 or \u2018not-yet developed\u2019 due to their age. Raising critical self-awareness of adultcentrism among adults in educational contexts can support them to develop more age-inclusive attitudes towards children and youth in daily life. However, this process of raising critical self-awareness related to one\u2019s own adult age can bring up emotional responses e.g., fear, guilt, insecurity, denial etc. that can create obstacles in the learning process of adults and might worsen intergenerational differences.\n\nThe central challenge in this course is to propose a game to be used by adults to raise the awareness of the psychological concept of \u2018adultcentrism\u2019 among adults in educational relationships with children and youth.\n\nA key ethical question in developing a game for this purpose is whether the design of such a game\u00A0 is age-sensitive towards adult learners.\n\nThe participants work in a Challenge Based Learning framework to propose a game designed for raising critical self-awareness i.e., of adult-centric biases, among adults in educational relationships with children and youth. The activities include readings, podcasts, teamwork, lectures and workshops. Participants will work part-time, digitally, over a period of three months with a 5-day visit to the University of Stavanger."},"LearningAchievementSpecification":{"EQFLevel":{"InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/snb/eqf/25831c2","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"Level 6"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/snb/eqf/6","Type":"Concept"},"CreditPoint":{"Framework":{"InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/snb/education-credit/25831c2","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"European Credit Transfer System"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/snb/education-credit/6fcec5c5af","Type":"Concept"},"Point":"3,0","Id":"urn:epass:creditPoint:1708ff00-af7a-4f21-ae9b-d1d2ddabec2e","Type":"CreditPoint"},"LearningOutcome":[{"Title":{"En":"Learning outcome 1"},"RelatedESCOSkill":[{"Notation":"Skill","InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/concept-scheme/skills","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"think creatively"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/skill/c624c6a3-b0ba-4a31-a296-0d433fe47e41","Type":"Concept"}],"AdditionalNote":{"NoteLiteral":{"En":"The candidate has knowledge of critical developments in age-inclusive educational research and psychology.\n"},"Id":"urn:eciu:note:45ec8970-0ef7-ee11-a1fd-000d3a279d1c","Type":"Note"},"Id":"urn:epass:learningOutcome:1708ff00-af7a-4f21-ae9b-d1d2ddabec2e-1","Type":"LearningOutcome"},{"Title":{"En":"Learning outcome 2"},"RelatedESCOSkill":[{"Notation":"Skill","InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/concept-scheme/skills","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"think innovately"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/skill/c2a0c52c-0b4b-4180-a918-92650ea3b458","Type":"Concept"}],"AdditionalNote":{"NoteLiteral":{"En":"The candidate has knowledge of the Challenge Based Learning (CBL) method."},"Id":"urn:eciu:note:4d2adb8e-0ef7-ee11-a1fd-000d3a279d1c","Type":"Note"},"Id":"urn:epass:learningOutcome:1708ff00-af7a-4f21-ae9b-d1d2ddabec2e-2","Type":"LearningOutcome"},{"Title":{"En":"Learning outcome 3"},"RelatedESCOSkill":[{"Notation":"Skill","InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/concept-scheme/skills","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"respect the diversity of cultural values and norms"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/skill/5ca953f7-541d-4f67-bc55-7721348366cf","Type":"Concept"}],"AdditionalNote":{"NoteLiteral":{"En":"The candidate can apply critical knowledge to promote more age-inclusive intergenerational relationships.
