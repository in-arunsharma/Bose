Students need to ground their reflections by exploring some specific areas: business environment, competition, suppliers, partners, environmental and sustainability issues, etc, both deductively (i.e., through desk research) and inductively (i.e., through field work) as appropriate.\n\nTo address their challenge/question, the students will cover the 4 generic steps of an explorative business analysis:\n\n\u2022 Identification of the relevant challenge/question,\n\n\u2022 Acquisition of applicable concepts/methods/tools,\n\n\u2022 Observations (data collection) on a selected part of the case,\n\n\u2022 Analysis and interpretation.\n\nStudents\u2019 supervision comprises:\n\n\u2022 A few group sessions to introduce and detail the assignments, and help students identify the challenges/questions,\n\n\u2022 1-to-many mentoring sessions, where teams will be coached in completing their case study, and progress will be monitored,\n\n\u2022 A final oral defence.\n\nEach student will be in charge of a part of the group\u2019s delivery, with specific \u201Croles\u201D defined during the mentoring sessions.\n\nThe companies responsible for the case will contribute to supervision, provide data/contacts, participate in the oral defence and/or offer other meeting occasions to ensure rooting of the business assignment in real life.\n\nWhile the course foresees several (4-5) plenary lectures covering topics that are of general use to all students, most of the time will be dedicated to group mentoring.\n\n**Course Goals and Learning Objectives**\n\nAfter completion of the I\u0026E Studies course, students should\u2026\n\n\u2022 \u2026 have the ability to apply, synthesise, and evaluate prior I\u0026E learning within a specific innovation or entrepreneurial project setting and a specific innovation area.\n\n\u2022 \u2026 have the ability to conduct a business analysis, make decisions and formulate recommendations or justify actions in a real environment.\n\n\u2022 \u2026 have the ability to choose and apply relevant concepts/methods and/or tools and collect relevant data for conducting a business analysis and making decisions in a real environment.\n\n\u2022 \u2026 have the ability to produce a professional writing on a business analysis topic.\n\n\u2022 \u2026 have the ability to apply concepts, methods and tools pertaining to identifying and assessing the impact/value of a technology in an industry, market and/or organisation and the innovation / business opportunities it creates.\n\n\u2022 \u2026 have the ability to reflect critically on issues related to the development of ICT solutions, and their potential pitfalls due to market and/or social reasons.\n\n\u2022 \u2026 have developed a sense of \u0022out of the box thinking\u0022 and creative approaches to problem solving, even in contexts that would otherwise suggest a technical solution.\n\n\u2022 \u2026 have the ability to make value and ethical judgements about the development of technological and business solutions.\n\n\u2022 \u2026 have the ability to work as a team with other students to complement each other\u0027s competences and perspectives."},"LearningAchievementSpecification":{"EQFLevel":{"InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/snb/eqf/25831c2","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"Level

Criteria**\n\nThe course is evaluated based on a group oral defence, a written group report, and student individual contributions.\n\nThe presentation is delivered in front of a panel composed by the course\u2019s teachers and representatives of the team\u2019s assigned challenge provider. Each presentation should last a maximum of 15 minutes (precise timing will be given during the lectures).\n\nThe group report includes both points of content (i.e., what the students were able to perform and their proposed solutions) and of process (i.e., decision-making points, how conclusions were reached, team organization, specific contributions of each team member). The approximate length of the report is 15 pages, and it should be delivered both to the teachers for evaluation and, if requested, to the challenge providers for their interest.\n\nBoth the presentation and the group report are evaluated on a 0-100 scale using a grading rubric. The final mark is composed by 1/3rd from the presentation and by 2/3rds from the report, with the presentation being evaluated both by teachers and challenge providers with equal grading weight. This score is then converted to the standard 0-30 Italian scale.\n\nThis score is adjusted based on each student\u2019s individual contribution through two bonuses: a 0-2 point bonus based on the quality of the student\u2019s section in the final report, and a 0-2 point bonus based on the student\u2019s performance within their team during the course.\n\n**Books and study materials**\n\nNo textbook is required. Reference articles and bibliography will be provided to students by the lecturers, and on a case-by-case basis depending on each student\u0027s need.\n\nCommonly-referenced books are:\n\n- Roberto Poli, Working with the Future, 2020\n\n- Rob Fitzpatrick, The Mom Test, 2016\n\n- Joshua Schimel, Writing Science, 2011\n\n**Additional Information**\n\nThe course\u2019s Moodle page is hosted on the Teaching UNiTrentoinfrastructure.
