One sector in which hydrogen and SAF are expected to play an important role is aviation. Aircraft manufacturers, airlines and airports are developing new technologies and utilization concepts. Hamburg Airport, for example, is preparing for the future use of hydrogen and SAF.  \n\nBut is it realistic to believe that we are moving towards a carbon-free aviation? What are the limiting factors? What ideas do you have for designing an efficient and reliable hydrogen and SAF supply system?  \n\nMany factors need to be considered and can be analyzed in this challenge.\u00A0Be part of this journey and get to know Airbus\u0027, HAM Airport\u2019s and DLR\u2019s current plans and visions, work on alternatives and scenarios that you consider important\u00A0and bring in your own creativity.  \n\nExperience working in an international group under the supervision of the teamchers and industry stakeholders.
