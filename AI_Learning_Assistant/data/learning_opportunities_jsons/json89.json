This challenge invites you to rethink how personalised guidance can empower learners to achieve their goals. Using cutting-edge AI technologies, you\u0027ll co-create solutions that support diverse learner and professional needs and preferences while exploring the digital landscape with Microsoft Co-pilot platform and Virtual Reality with Microsoft Mesh environment where you can interact with your own digital avatars in a virtual classroom.\n\nThrough a dynamic program combining online sessions and an intensive three-day workshop at Tampere university, you will learn how to create AI agents capable of providing personalized assistance in learning and competence development, such as in the ECIU Engage platform. With opportunities to design assistants with different characteristics, response styles, and functionalities, you\u2019ll have the freedom to create, innovate and experiment. Guided by workshops, expert mentoring, and peer collaboration, you\u2019ll develop a prototype that balances ease of use, response accuracy, and effective learner guidance. Your designs will be evaluated by AI specialists, pushing you to deliver impactful, practical solutions.\n\nBy joining this challenge, you\u2019ll develop AI prototypes that serve as personalised assistants for assisting individuals in learning and in competence development in digital environments (AI chatbot) or Virtual Realities (AI avatar). The prototypes can contribute to navigating the ECIU Engage platform and make a lasting contribution to the way ECIU offers learner guidance,\u00A0designed for students, by students! These assistants will offer tailored guidance, adapt to individual learner styles, and potentially integrate seamlessly into the existing Engage platform. The final prototypes will be evaluated by AI experts based on usability, accuracy, and effectiveness in supporting learner journeys. The potential for further development by the ECIU will be evaluated as well.\n\nThe ECIU AI hackathon is organized in collaboration with Gameful Realities research center and EVIL-AI project."},"LearningAchievementSpecification":{"EQFLevel":{"InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/snb/eqf/25831c2","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"Level

will work in teams to address the \u2018wicked problem\u2019 of developing personalised learning assistants for the 21st century to suit a variety of user needs. Thinking broadly to begin with, as you explore the AI tools provided prior to the hackathon and then in workshop style during it, you will work in teams to create either a text-based AI assistant chatbot with Microsoft Co-pilot or an AI avatar assistant in the Microsoft Mesh Virtual Reality (VR) environment, or both. \u00A0You will have the opportunity to unleash your creative and imaginative potential, and you can also think about including elements of gamification. It will also be important to consider the user experience and ethical implications of AI, data capture and personalisation.  \n\nThe final prototypes will be judged by AI experts on criteria such as ease of use, response accuracy, ability to guide the competence development of individuals and so on.  \n\nDuring this whole course you will:\n\n- Collaborate with a diverse team of peers, mentors, and stakeholders.\n- Design, test, and refine AI agents tailored to unique learner needs.\n- Experiment with Microsoft co-pilot for chatbot creation and/or Mesh environment for VR avatar creation to enhance the learning experience.\n- Learn advanced techniques in AI development, user experience design, and educational innovation.\n\nThe challenge kicks off with online sessions to introduce you to the tools, methods, and goals of AI development for personalised learning and the suggested readings will be explained.\n\n**Timeline:**\n\nFeb 26th online kick-off\n\nFeb 26th \u2013 March 11th participants work in teams with pre-materials\n\nMarch 11th-14th in-person programme at Paidia, Tampere,\u00A0where you\u2019ll be guided by expert coaching and supported by interactive workshops and you\u2019ll translate your ideas into functional AI solution..
