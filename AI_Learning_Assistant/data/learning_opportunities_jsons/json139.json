It is a technology that involves security and innovation and results in a pattern identification solution that confirms a person\u0027s identity by combining biological and/or behavioral characteristics, with biometric characteristics. Biometric characteristics are a very convenient way to authenticate a person, as they have a high degree of security and cannot be stolen, forgotten, or lost. In any business sector where customer identification is part of everyday activities, such as in banking, financial services industries, healthcare, and telecommunications, biometrics significantly reduces the time consumed in identifying customers/members/patients or identity selection. Taking advantage of the relevance of Biometrics for technological advancement and digital transformation of the industrial sector, this micro-credential aims to qualify graduates for the implementation and use of biometrics systems in their various applications."},"LearningAchievementSpecification":{"EQFLevel":{"InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/snb/eqf/25831c2","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"Level

Teaching methods\n\nInnovative teaching approaches will be used to improve student engagement and learning outcomes. Among the methodologies employed, active learning will occupy a large part of the training, using effective strategies such as Project-Based Learning (PBL) and Flipped Classroom.  \n\n# Schedule and final event in Portugal\n\nClasses take place online from 2 to 20 September 2024 with a total of 20 contact hours planned for this course. During the final week of the programme, from 16 to 20 September, a final event, including academic activities and a fun social programme, will take place at the University of Aveiro campus in Portugal at the IEETA complex.  \n\n# Travel and Accommodation Costs\n\nThe ECIU has set up a mobility fund to contribute to travel and accommodation of participants in ECIU courses and events. **We strongly recommend:\u00A0before you submit your application, please contact the mobility officers for details of the procedures to apply for a mobility grant for this ECIU micromodule**. To contact them, just use the Contact Us form. Choose the option \u0022I have a question on mobility support\u0022 ask our team what you need to do to apply for some travel funding. **If, however, given the holiday period**, you do not get the funding before the application deadline for the Biometry course, just apply to the course anyway so you don\u0027t get left out.  \n  \nPlease not that you will also receive full details of travel and accommodation arrangements for the event on the first day of the course.\u00A0\n\n# Assessment\n\nThe evaluation process to be adopted will include feedback dynamics, project development, and oral presentation to an audience. Learning assessment will be based on student performance in the following components:\n\nBiometry project, with a written report and an oral presentation (70% of the final classification). The assessment will happen in two moments, one in the middle of the microcredential and another one in the end, with 30% and 40% weight in the final classification respectively.\n\nPerformance in class - Group discussion activity in class (30% weight in the final classification).","Subject":{"InScheme":{"Id":"urn:eciu:note","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"ParticipantInformation"},"Id":"05994492-c929-4ed4-b501-8531cf2ea175","Type":"Concept"}}],"HasPart":null,"Id":"urn:eciu:learningActivitySpec:05994492-c929-4ed4-b501-8531cf2ea175","Type":"LearningActivitySpecification"},"BannerImage":null,"MoreInformation":[{"NoteLiteral":"","Subject":{"InScheme":{"Id":"urn:eciu:note","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"SourceIdentifier"},"Id":"05994492-c929-4ed4-b501-8531cf2ea175","Type":"Concept"}},{"NoteLiteral":"","Subject":{"InScheme":{"Id":"urn:eciu:note","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"SubTitle"},"Id":"05994492-c929-4ed4-b501-8531cf2ea175","Type":"Concept"}},{"NoteLiteral":"This is a repeat of a popular ECIU micro-credential aimed to enable the learner to understand the scope of use of biometric authentication and to implement algorithms related to biometric identification.
