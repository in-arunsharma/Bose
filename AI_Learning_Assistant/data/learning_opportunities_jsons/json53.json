Politicians, scientists and industry players generally agree that hydrogen can be used in a wide range of applications - and in some cases must be used to achieve ambitious climate protection goals. These considerations focus in particular on green hydrogen, which is produced in a climate-neutral way.\n\nIn this fully self-paced online course you will get a comprehensive overview of the background of the discussion about the use of green hydrogen as an energy carrier. You can build up knowledge regarding the technological basics and understand the connections between hydrogen and renewable energies in future, sustainable energy systems.\n\nYou can go through the single chapters according to your own demands and at your own pace. We recommend reading the module texts first and then watching the topic-specific expert lectures, as their content goes into a little more detail.\n\nThe course is recoemmendet for all learners participating in th Challenge \u0022Hydrogen and Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) \u2013 Key Factors for Carbon-Free Aviation?\u0022\n\nThis course were created in Aug 2021 by Fabian Carels and Lisa Karies, two scientist of Technische Universit\u00E4t Hamburg."},"LearningAchievementSpecification":{"EQFLevel":{"InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/snb/eqf/25831c2","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"Level 7"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/snb/eqf/7","Type":"Concept"},"CreditPoint":null,"LearningOutcome":[{"Title":{"En":"Comprehensive overview of the discussion about the use of green hydrogen as an energy carrier."},"RelatedESCOSkill":[{"Notation":"Skill","InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/concept-scheme/skills","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"minimise environmental impact on the surrounding area"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/skill/44493977-83c4-49e0-88b2-28435da57cd0","Type":"Concept"}],"AdditionalNote":{"NoteLiteral":{"En":"At the end of the course learners got a comprehensive overview of the background of the discussion about the use of green hydrogen as an energy carrier."},"Id":"urn:eciu:note:fafe41d3-07ea-ef11-be20-7c1e52119bde","Type":"Note"},"Id":"urn:epass:learningOutcome:b4176339-0619-462c-98d1-1fa0c7bd7d4a-1","Type":"LearningOutcome"},{"Title":{"En":"Knowledge regarding the technological basics of green hydrogen and it\u0027s production."},"RelatedESCOSkill":[{"Notation":"Skill","InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/concept-scheme/skills","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"assess hydrogen production technologies"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/skill/5e641832-dafe-46fa-8e0a-b29b223f985a","Type":"Concept"}],"AdditionalNote":{"NoteLiteral":{"En":"At the end of the course the learners will have built up knowledge regarding the technological basics of green hydrogen and it\u0027s production."},"Id":"urn:eciu:note:8e37c553-08ea-ef11-be20-7c1e52119bde","Type":"Note"},"Id":"urn:epass:learningOutcome:b4176339-0619-462c-98d1-1fa0c7bd7d4a-2","Type":"LearningOutcome"},{"Title":{"En":"Understand the connections between hydrogen and renewable energies in future energy systems"},"RelatedESCOSkill":[{"Notation":"Skill","InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/concept-scheme/skills","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"promote sustainable energy"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/skill/1a6c7e0d-fc13-41d7-a5c0-8ca00606de89","Type":"Concept"},{"Notation":"Skill","InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/concept-scheme/skills","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"renewable energy technologies"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/skill/f8413360-6114-40de-a276-c59b764b9913","Type":"Concept"}],"AdditionalNote":{"NoteLiteral":{"En":"By the en of the course learners understand the connections between hydrogen and renewable energies in future, sustainable energy systems."},"Id":"urn:eciu:note:cfff5a08-0aea-ef11-be20-7c1e52119bde","Type":"Note"},"Id":"urn:epass:learningOutcome:b4176339-0619-462c-98d1-1fa0c7bd7d4a-3","Type":"LearningOutcome"}],"LearningSetting":null,"Mode":null,"Title":{"En":"Green Hydrogen"},"DcType":null,"HomePage":null,"VolumeOfLearning":"PT10H","Id":"urn:eciu:qualification:b4176339-0619-462c-98d1-1fa0c7bd7d4a","Type":"Qualification"},"IsPartOf":{"Mode":null,"DcType":null,"Title":{"En":"Green Hydrogen"},"AdmissionsProcedure":null,"ApplicationDeadline":null,"Description":null,"LearningAchievementSpecification":null,"IsPartOf":null,"Temporal":null,"ProvidedBy":null,"LearningActivitySpecification":null,"BannerImage":null,"MoreInformation":null,"Id":"urn:eciu:learningOpportunity:3f92059a-06ea-ef11-be20-7c1e52119bde","Type":"LearningOpportunity"},"Temporal":{"EndDate":"2025-02-20T00:00:00Z","Name":{"En":"Temporal"},"StartDate":"2026-01-12T00:00:00Z"},"ProvidedBy":{"Location":null,"Logo":null,"LegalName":{"En":"TECHNISCHE UNIVERSITAT HAMBURG (TUHH"},"Registration":null,"Homepage":null,"Id":"urn:eciu:org:d2f87009-6a54-ed11-bba2-6045bd886566","Type":"Organisation"},"LearningActivitySpecification":{"Mode":null,"DcType":null,"Title":{"En":""},"Description":null,"MoreInformation":[{"NoteLiteral":"Please keep in mind: since it takes you less then 10 h to go through the materials and there is no assessemnt of your learning no ECTS and no micro-credential is awarded.
