Engineers, business leaders, managers, and policy-makers are all needed to drive this change. Want to be one of the graduates leading the way?\u00A0Circular Sustainable Business Development\u00A0is the course for you! This exciting, multi-disciplinary course is open to all master\u2019s students at UT.\n\n**Why Circular Economy Matters**\n\nIn a world focused on sustainability, the circular economy is key to transforming how we produce and consume. As future decision-makers and leaders, it\u2019s essential for students to understand the circular economy in relation to the\u00A0triple bottom line: People (social impact), Planet (environmental impact), and Profit (economic viability). Through this course, you\u0027ll learn how to integrate these elements into business strategy and explore corporate social responsibility from all angles.\n\n**What You\u2019ll Learn**\n\nThe course kicks off with the basics of sustainable and circular economies, packed with real-world examples of success stories at the global, national, and regional levels. From there, you\u2019ll work on a challenge-based group project (worth 25% of your grade) to tackle specific sustainability problems.\n\n**Core Topics Covered:**\n\n- **Sustainable Business Models:** Discover how companies can create value from an economic, environmental, and social perspective using the\u00A0Triple Layered Business Model Canvas (BMC). This tool will allow you to think beyond just profits, incorporating life cycle and stakeholder perspectives.\n- **Real-World Impact:** Explore how different sectors, from manufacturing to pharmaceuticals and agri-food, are affected by sustainability, and learn the techniques for\u00A0measuring sustainability\u00A0effectively.\n- **Sustainability in Supply Chains:** You\u2019ll dive into value recovery from end-of-life products and learn how businesses can shift from linear to circular models. A\u00A0serious game\u00A0simulating real-world decision-making will reinforce your learning (worth 25% of your grade). This game will take place at\u00A0the campus of the University of Twente in Enschede, the Netherlands (see Participant\u00A0information).\n- **Hands-On Experience:** From\u00A0Life Cycle Assessments\u00A0to\u00A0agent-based modeling\u00A0and\u00A0game theory, you\u2019ll develop practical skills that will help you lead sustainable business practices.\n\n**Engage with Big Ideas**\n\nIn the final weeks, you\u2019ll explore cutting-edge topics driven by your own interests\u2014like food waste, electronic waste management, or the evolution of eco-industrial parks. You\u2019ll finish the course with a final\u00A0individual written exam (worth 50% of your grade) that ties everything together.\n\nThis course is your gateway to becoming a key player in the circular economy transition.
