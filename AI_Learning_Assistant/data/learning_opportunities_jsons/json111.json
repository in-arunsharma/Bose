like many post-industrial cities, is grappling with significant challenges related to depopulation and the ongoing brain drain of its young, educated population. Many students acquire specialized skills here only to leave the city after graduation in search of better opportunities elsewhere. At the same time, the city is undertaking efforts to invest in digital technologies, recognizing that innovation is a key driver of sustainable urban development. This digital transformation aims to enhance the quality of life for residents, streamline services, and attract new investment. However, the process of digital transition comes with its own set of complexities and challenges. One of the primary questions then is whether the city is truly ready to redefine the experience of young citizens in the digital age. The critical challenge here is how a city like \u0141\u00F3d\u017A can design environments that resonate with young, digitally-savvy citizens, who are accustomed to high-tech, fast-paced lifestyles. This includes addressing the issue of whether these young residents will be willing to take full advantage of the digital opportunities that cities offer. Are they truly interested in engaging with civic technologies, or will they see them as impersonal, bureaucratic tools rather than a means of enriching their daily lives? The challenge also provides an opportunity to develop learners\u2019 transversal skills and enhance their performance during presentations but also during the process of applying for a job. Cooperation, cocreation, pitching, peer learning and peer assessment, providing constructive feedback will play a pivotal role in this challenge aspect.","Subject":{"InScheme":{"Id":"urn:eciu:note","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"Introduction"},"Id":"15a37657-41bc-4ac2-a201-688199cf50e5","Type":"Concept"}},{"NoteLiteral":"True","Subject":{"InScheme":{"Id":"urn:eciu:note","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"GenerateMicroCredentials"},"Id":"15a37657-41bc-4ac2-a201-688199cf50e5","Type":"Concept"}},{"NoteLiteral":"This challenge starts in March 2025 and ends in May 2025.
