What new structures and strategies for circular value and supply chains will emerge? What governance modes, value chains, transformation scenarios, and new stakeholders will appear? And how intense their engagement needs to be to make the value of the supply chains circle?\n\nThe micromodule provides the latest theoretical and practical knowledge on how to successfully support the entire value or supply chain in becoming more circular and sustainable. This micromodule covers four major and interconnected topics: the transformation of global value chains challenged by sustainability pressure; the concept of circular value and supply chains as pivotal elements for industries to become more circular; the concept of stakeholder engagement as a cornerstone for integrating circular practices throughout the value chain; and the main enablers supporting the transformation of entire value or supply chains towards greater circularity and sustainability.\n\nThe module\u0027s content directly aligns with real-world scenarios. Europe aims for a competitive and climate-neutral economy. The imperative for value or supply chains to be circular and sustainable is undeniable and driven by the necessity to mitigate climate change, improve resource efficiency, reduce waste, comply with regulations, align with consumer preferences, and ensure long-term economic viability and resilience."},"LearningAchievementSpecification":{"EQFLevel":{"InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/snb/eqf/25831c2","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"Level
