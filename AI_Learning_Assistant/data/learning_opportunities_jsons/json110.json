However, there is no set itinerary. The fun comes from trying to find the best way to go. In competitive orienteering, the challenge is to complete the course in the quickest time possible.\n\nPark World Tour Italy (PWT) is a non-profit sports association founded in 2007. Its aim is to promote the diffusion, coordination and practice, also at an educational level of orienteering. In recent years, PWT has begun to work on the preparation of high-level athletes and on the development of an innovative vision of orienteering. This new vision takes into account changes in society and leverages the many skills and technical competences present within the association.\n\nOrienteering is a niche sport in Italy: there are less than 7000 members of the orienteering Italian federation and PWT is trying to explore its potential that is not yet fully explored.

There will be lessons regarding sport and innovation held by experts and learners will meet athletes who will be sharing their experiences in the field of orienteering. After the week in Trento, the learners will continue working on the challenge. In the online phase they will be accompanied by the challenge provider and teachers in some mentoring sessions, useful for better investigating the problem and receiving feedback on the research methodology.
