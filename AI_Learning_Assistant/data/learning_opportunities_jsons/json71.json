Principles for and applications of anaerobic digestion of organic waste will be covered, as well as opportunities and obstacles for the implementation of biogas technology in various contexts. This iteration of the module focuses on research related challenges of biogas production. The learners will have the opportunity to choose and work on one of four challenges provided by Link\u00F6ping University researchers working on different aspects of the AD process:\n\n**Challenge 1: Antimicrobial Resistance and Anaerobic Digestion**\n\nAntimicrobial resistance (AMR) is the ability of microorganisms to resist the effects of drugs that are meant to kill or inhibit them.\u00A0It can lead to infections that are difficult or impossible to treat, and increase the risk of disease transmission and mortality. One of the main drivers of this is\u00A0the overuse and misuse of antibiotics in animal farming, as antibiotics pass from animal waste to the environment and affect the microbial communities. Although AD can be an effective method to reduce the environmental impact of animal waste, its impact on AMR is not well understood. In this challenge, learners will have to develop solutions on how an AD system can effectively reduce AMR in animal waste while producing biogas as a renewable energy source. The solutions can combine technical, legislative and policy aspects.\u00A0\n\n**Challenge 2: Carbon Capture Utilization and Storage (CCUS)**\n\nDuring the production of high-quality biogas, CO2 molecules are released into the atmosphere. These emissions are biogenic and considered neutral. However, they can result in less atmospheric CO2 if they are captured at point-sources, and then are either permanently stored (Carbon Capture and Storage - CCS) or used in production (Carbon Captured Utilization). Currently there is a lack of policy and funding instruments globally to promote and facilitate CCS and CCU, that combined are referred to as CCUS. Learners working on this challenge will be tasked to come up with solutions that address the lack of policy and funding for CCUS.\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0\u00A0\n\n**Challenge 3:\u00A0Medium Chain Carboxylic Acids (MCCAs)**\n\nMedium Chain Carboxylic Acids (MCCAs) are valuable chemicals that can be used in various industrial applications, including biofuels, lubricants, and pharmaceuticals. Producing MCCAs from organic waste through AD systems presents a promising opportunity to create value-added products while addressing waste management issues. This challenge encourages learners to develop innovative methods for optimizing MCCA production from AD systems, contributing to the development of a circular bioeconomy and reducing environmental impact.\u00A0\n\n**Challenge 4: Nanotechnology and Anaerobic Digestion**\n\nOne of the strategies for improving the biogas production process is the use of nanotechnology, though which anaerobic digestion can be stimulated and harmful substances mitigated. However, the presence of nanoparticles,\u00A0depending on their chemical composition and concentration, can inhibit the AD process. In some cases can even represent a potential environmental threat if the product of AD is used as a biofertilizer. For what is more, the production and addition of nanoparticles can increase the cost of biogas production. In this challenge, learners will have to propose strategy solutions to make the addition of nanoparticles in the AD process cost effective, environmental friendly and safe for the soil.\u00A0\n\nEach learner will work on **only one** challenge. Challenges will be allocated based on the learners preferences and the needs of the module.\n\n**Schedule**\n\nThe module will be given in blended mode, with most of the activities online and a mandatory face-to-face (F2F) week from 30 September to 4 October.
