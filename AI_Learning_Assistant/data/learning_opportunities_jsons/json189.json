What exactly is going on inside of your small, wrinkly mass while you read this text?\u00A0 Keeping muscles fit and powerful requires hard work. The same concept holds true for your brain, an amazing organ with the ability to change, adapt and get stronger. According to a new study by the researchers from University College in London, recent advances in generative AI help to explain how memories enable us to learn about the world, re-live old experiences and construct totally new experiences for imagination and planning. This message came from the understanding human cognitive neuroscience. As the cognitive neuroscience examines the biological processes that help us to understand complex mental functions such as memory, language, emotion, perception, attention, and consciousness.\u00A0While psychology focuses on understanding the structure of the mind through behavioural experiments. The aim of the micromodule is to provide knowledge and develop abilities in the assessment of competencies using cognitive neuroscience techniques. At the end of the micromodule students will be able to understand concepts, rules, and procedures of cognitive neuroscience.\u00A0The playing role of attention, motivation, and sensory adaptation in different kind of perception will be explained. By networking to understand memorization, attention, and decision-making process\u00A0in uncertain scenarios. Also, be able to articulate strategies for fostering critical thinking and explain the relationship between critical thinking and innovation."},"LearningAchievementSpecification":{"EQFLevel":{"InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/snb/eqf/25831c2","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"Level

It is at the intersection of psychology and neuroscience, but also overlaps with physiological psychology, cognitive psychology, and neuropsychology. It combines the theories of cognitive psychology and computational modelling with experimental data about the brain. Research in cognitive neuroscience can help form a deeper understanding of critical thinking processes and how to foster them in an organization. Understanding how the brain works can be applied to develop innovative strategies and promote creativity and innovation. Brain research can be used to understand how people respond to risk, and this can be useful in the strategic decision-making process. Cognitive neuroscience can help understand how people generate new ideas and solutions and how creativity and innovative thinking are fostered. This can be useful for driving innovation and improving business performance. Cognitive neuroscience can help improve productivity and concentration by helping understand how people perceive their environment and how they focus on certain things. This can be useful both in the workplace and in everyday life.","Subject":{"InScheme":{"Id":"urn:eciu:note","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"Introduction"},"Id":"b0884572-a053-436b-b2fd-d043a974339b","Type":"Concept"}},{"NoteLiteral":"True","Subject":{"InScheme":{"Id":"urn:eciu:note","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"GenerateMicroCredentials"},"Id":"b0884572-a053-436b-b2fd-d043a974339b","Type":"Concept"}},{"NoteLiteral":"Entry requirements:\n\n- Student at any of the universities of the ECIU;\n- B2 level of English language proficiency.\n\nApplicants need to attach a copy of ID card / passport (document issued by the country of origin) to enrol in the KTU virtual learning environment.
