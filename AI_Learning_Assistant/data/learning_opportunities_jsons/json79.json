They are not only excluded from social life, but even more so, from access to play and from developing their autonomy and skills in their natural environment (home, school, park).  \n\nThe fact that they have different abilities from the rest of the population not only excludes them from society but also condemns them to depend on another person who has to do everything for them. Today\u0027s society is highly computerised, with infinite technological resources, where everything or almost everything can be controlled from mobile devices, tablets or computers. **But what about people who, because of their disability, cannot access or interact with these devices that control everything?**\n\nIn this challenge, we work together with [Nexe Fundaci\u00F3](https://nexefundacio.org/), an organization that has been dedicated for 40 years to improving the quality of life of children with multiple disabilities and their families, as well as defending their rights."},"LearningAchievementSpecification":{"EQFLevel":{"InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/snb/eqf/25831c2","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"Level

Often these people end up needing to be accompanied by an adult to carry out any activity, thus limiting their autonomy.\n\nTechnology adapted to the needs of children with disabilities can help reduce their dependency. We live in a digitalised and technological world, but existing technological solutions are often inaccessible or unknown to families, who cannot integrate them into their daily lives.\n\nTherefore, a comprehensive approach is needed.
