The importance of the laser-related research field was acknowledged by several Nobel prizes in Physics given for the development of the laser itself and more recently for advances in pulsed laser development via chirped pulse amplification method and laser applications like manipulation of micro-objects. This micro-module is devoted to attendees interested in emerging technologies in photonics and does not require more than basic knowledge of physics. In this micro-module, you will learn the principles of laser operation and will find out the variety of application possibilities of ultrafast laser sources in scientific research as well as in commercial products. You\u2019ll be able to explain why ultra-short laser pulses are necessary for creating high-tech products."},"LearningAchievementSpecification":{"EQFLevel":{"InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/snb/eqf/25831c2","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"Level 7"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/snb/eqf/7","Type":"Concept"},"CreditPoint":{"Framework":{"InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/snb/education-credit/25831c2","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"European Credit Transfer System"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/snb/education-credit/6fcec5c5af","Type":"Concept"},"Point":"2,0","Id":"urn:epass:creditPoint:a39de4ff-48bc-ef11-b8e8-6045bd8e221f","Type":"CreditPoint"},"LearningOutcome":[{"Title":{"En":"Interpret working principles of continuous wave and pulsed lasers"},"RelatedESCOSkill":[{"Notation":"Skill","InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/concept-scheme/skills","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"think innovately"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/skill/c2a0c52c-0b4b-4180-a918-92650ea3b458","Type":"Concept"}],"AdditionalNote":{"NoteLiteral":{"En":"The selection of laser working parameters is crucial to apply these devices for different applications.
