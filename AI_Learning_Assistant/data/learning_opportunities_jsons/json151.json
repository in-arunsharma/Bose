The company\u2019s customers are the residents of Vilnius, and every day, services are provided to nearly 220,000 Vilnius clients, heating almost 7,500 buildings. We not only provide heat to the city\u2019s residents but also heat for hot tap water. The consumption of hot water during the day has its peaks and managing them is crucial whole year. A sudden increase in hot water usage places a heavy load on the production chain, which also needs to maintain the temperature required for heating. While managing this is a technical necessity, it also impacts customer satisfaction, energy efficiency, and the broader goals of sustainability.  \n\nWhat possible solutions, using technologies or other means, could help manage consumption peaks and minimize their impact?  \n\nWe aim to discover innovative, actionable solutions to manage hot water consumption peaks more effectively and minimize their impact on our production chain. These solutions may include technological innovations, smart systems, or creative non-technical approaches.  \n\nThe energy sector is a field where technological advancement and innovation intersect with sustainability and purpose. The solutions implemented in the sector not only affect companies as economic entities but also have a significant impact on customers satisfaction and the overall goal of sustainability and a cleaner world.  \n\nThis is more than just a challenge\u2014it\u2019s a chance to solve a real-world problem for one of the largest district heating companies in the Baltic States. By participating, you\u2019ll gain valuable experience in tackling complex issues, working with industry-relevant scenarios, and contributing to meaningful solutions that can shape the future of energy management."},"LearningAchievementSpecification":{"EQFLevel":{"InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/snb/eqf/25831c2","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"Level
