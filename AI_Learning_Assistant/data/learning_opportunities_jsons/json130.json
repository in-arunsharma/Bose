Project management methodologies play a pivotal role in driving transformations across diverse domains, fostering innovation, and realizing strategic objectives.\u00A0 Project success is measured by criteria such as scope, time, cost, quality and stakeholder satisfaction.\u00A0 The project management golden triangle, a fundamental construct in this discipline, comprises three interlinked variables - scope, cost, and time - that collectively determine the project\u0027s quality. To achieve project success in various businesses and manage those three elements, the project manager must have a deep understanding of each element and where they have the opportunity to be flexible to accommodate changes throughout the project."},"LearningAchievementSpecification":{"EQFLevel":{"InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/snb/eqf/25831c2","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"Level 7"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/snb/eqf/7","Type":"Concept"},"CreditPoint":{"Framework":{"InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/snb/education-credit/25831c2","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"European Credit Transfer System"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/snb/education-credit/6fcec5c5af","Type":"Concept"},"Point":"2,0","Id":"urn:epass:creditPoint:7fb1fcc4-69bc-ef11-b8e8-7c1e525dc572","Type":"CreditPoint"},"LearningOutcome":[{"Title":{"En":"Recognize projects and describe project scope"},"RelatedESCOSkill":[{"Notation":"Skill","InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/concept-scheme/skills","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"developing objectives and strategies"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/skill/6f89dcbe-4315-4533-8801-3aadf9190b86","Type":"Concept"},{"Notation":"Skill","InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/concept-scheme/skills","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"solving problems"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/skill/be7443ff-0747-43b8-8720-8e87fd34e692","Type":"Concept"}],"AdditionalNote":{"NoteLiteral":{"En":"Having completed course, the student should be able to describe the project concept and project environment, apply various techniques to describe project requirements, develop works breakdown structure, project deliverables, outputs and outcomes.
