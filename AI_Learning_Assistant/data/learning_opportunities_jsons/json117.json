This is the main incentive for the development of new technologies and production principles.\n\nTherefore, it is time to rethink manufacturing. This is necessary not only to survive the \u0022turbulent times\u0022, but also to maintain and improve the competitiveness of companies and their ability to meet the needs of society and consumers.\n\nIn this module you will learn about smart digital manufacturing, innovation processes, advanced production and organisation methods, sustainable manufacturing principles and the challenges of manufacturing transformation. You will be able to recognize the need for technological transformation, evaluate the potential of technologies, and create both technological and non-technological innovations aimed at fostering human-centred, resilient, and sustainable manufacturing. You will develop your skills thru a case study, where you will have to analyse and choose the best solution to the problem. This will allow you to focus your analytical skills and creativity to look at the manufacturing industry from a new, sustainable perspective. The knowledge and skills gained in this course will help you to propose solution for development of sustainable and digital manufacturing, transformation of manufacturing. The module consists of 6 topics and we will discuss Rethinking Manufacturing: challenges and opportunities; Supply Chain Transformation; Developing Multifunctional Digital Manufacturing; Sustainability in Industry 5.0 and Connecting Manufacturing to Customer Experience."},"LearningAchievementSpecification":{"EQFLevel":{"InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/snb/eqf/25831c2","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"Level 7"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/snb/eqf/7","Type":"Concept"},"CreditPoint":{"Framework":{"InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/snb/education-credit/25831c2","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"European Credit Transfer System"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/snb/education-credit/6fcec5c5af","Type":"Concept"},"Point":"2,0","Id":"urn:epass:creditPoint:6e93584e-7c1e-4b25-b004-741ab9e20001","Type":"CreditPoint"},"LearningOutcome":[{"Title":{"En":"Ability to recognise the need for technological transformation"},"RelatedESCOSkill":[{"Notation":"Skill","InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/concept-scheme/skills","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"think analytically"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/skill/4707da90-9cfc-46ca-8de0-38a0b7bfb137","Type":"Concept"}],"AdditionalNote":{"NoteLiteral":{"En":"Students will be able to recognise the need for technological transformation."},"Id":"urn:eciu:note:e7d83559-50bc-ef11-b8e8-6045bd943bbb","Type":"Note"},"Id":"urn:epass:learningOutcome:6e93584e-7c1e-4b25-b004-741ab9e20001-1","Type":"LearningOutcome"},{"Title":{"En":"Ability to assess the potential of digital technologies"},"RelatedESCOSkill":[{"Notation":"Skill","InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/concept-scheme/skills","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"evaluate data, information and digital content"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/skill/1d6c7de4-350e-4868-a47b-333b4b0d9650","Type":"Concept"}],"AdditionalNote":{"NoteLiteral":{"En":"Students will be able to assess the potential of digital technologies."},"Id":"urn:eciu:note:1dd57bb9-53bc-ef11-b8e8-6045bd9fad4d","Type":"Note"},"Id":"urn:epass:learningOutcome:6e93584e-7c1e-4b25-b004-741ab9e20001-2","Type":"LearningOutcome"},{"Title":{"En":"Ablity to propose technological and non-technological innovations"},"RelatedESCOSkill":[{"Notation":"Skill","InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/concept-scheme/skills","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"think innovately"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/skill/c2a0c52c-0b4b-4180-a918-92650ea3b458","Type":"Concept"}],"AdditionalNote":{"NoteLiteral":{"En":"Students will be able to propose technological and non-technological innovations for a human-centred, resilient and sustainable manufacturing industry."},"Id":"urn:eciu:note:e23bd8d0-54bc-ef11-b8e8-6045bd9fad4d","Type":"Note"},"Id":"urn:epass:learningOutcome:6e93584e-7c1e-4b25-b004-741ab9e20001-3","Type":"LearningOutcome"}],"LearningSetting":null,"Mode":null,"Title":{"En":"Rethinking Manufacturing"},"DcType":null,"HomePage":null,"VolumeOfLearning":null,"Id":"urn:eciu:qualification:6e93584e-7c1e-4b25-b004-741ab9e20001","Type":"Qualification"},"IsPartOf":{"Mode":null,"DcType":null,"Title":{"En":"Rethinking Manufacturing"},"AdmissionsProcedure":null,"ApplicationDeadline":null,"Description":null,"LearningAchievementSpecification":null,"IsPartOf":null,"Temporal":null,"ProvidedBy":null,"LearningActivitySpecification":null,"BannerImage":null,"MoreInformation":null,"Id":"urn:eciu:learningOpportunity:e7b01677-201d-ef11-840a-000d3a2a7e23","Type":"LearningOpportunity"},"Temporal":{"EndDate":"2025-03-17T00:00:00Z","Name":{"En":"Temporal"},"StartDate":"2025-04-17T00:00:00Z"},"ProvidedBy":{"Location":null,"Logo":null,"LegalName":{"En":"KAUNO TECHNOLOGIJOS UNIVERSITETAS (KTU)"},"Registration":null,"Homepage":null,"Id":"urn:eciu:org:4cc1e316-6a54-ed11-bba2-6045bd886566","Type":"Organisation"},"LearningActivitySpecification":{"Mode":null,"DcType":null,"Title":{"En":""},"Description":{"En":"[https://uais.cr.ktu.lt/ktuis/stp_report_ects.mdl_ml?p_kodas=MM00M110\u0026p_year=2024\u0026p_lang=EN\u0026p_stp_id=](https://uais.cr.ktu.lt/ktuis/stp_report_ects.mdl_ml?p_kodas=MM00M013\u0026amp;p_year=2024\u0026amp;p_lang=EN\u0026amp;p_stp_id=)"},"MoreInformation":[{"NoteLiteral":"Each week you will have access to several video lectures, which usually consist of 1-4 videos, each lasting 5-15 minutes. These videos will explain the underlying theory and provide instructions for hands-on exercises that illustrate real-world scenarios. Each week includes reading material, mostly research papers, reports and websites with relevant information. Each topic is connected with individual tasks. You will have to submit a written report for each task (2 reports per 3 week, 6 reports totally).\n\nYou will have the final exam at the end of micromodule (week 4).\n\nTo pass the micromodule, you must achieve a score of 50% or higher for each graded activity. The highest possible grade is 100%. When you complete all the required micromodule activities, you will earn a final grade. The following activities are weighted out of 100% of the micromodule: 60 % reports, 10% learner\u2019s activity, 30 % final exam.\n\nFor inquiries related to the micromodule content, please consult the Q\u0026A section at the end of each weekly tile or click on \u0027Discussion Forums\u0027 in the right menu of the Moodle course. Our teachers are committed to addressing your questions promptly. In the Q\u0026A forums, we encourage learners to engage respectfully and constructively, ensuring clarity and conciseness in queries while avoiding redundancy. Promote a collaborative environment by sharing insights and supporting peers, as courteous communication contributes to an enriched learning experience for all participants.\n\nThe micro-module will be delivered in the KTU virtual learning environment.
