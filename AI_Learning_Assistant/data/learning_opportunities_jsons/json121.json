The good thing is that you will not need a very specific initial knowledge of mathematics and even if you are afraid of mathematics this module is for you. One of the challenges of the module is to show how precise mathematical objects are used in historical and contemporary buildings and at the same time to show the scope of mathematics.\n\nDuring the micromodule you will get knowledge about proportions, golden section, symmetry, projective geometry, second-order curves, and surfaces and how they can be used in architectural objects. By providing examples and allowing you to choose your own chosen buildings for analysis, specific to the local culture or chosen style you like."},"LearningAchievementSpecification":{"EQFLevel":{"InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/snb/eqf/25831c2","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"Level 7"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/snb/eqf/7","Type":"Concept"},"CreditPoint":{"Framework":{"InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/snb/education-credit/25831c2","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"European Credit Transfer System"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/snb/education-credit/6fcec5c5af","Type":"Concept"},"Point":"1,0","Id":"urn:epass:creditPoint:115722d3-d6c3-408c-a9bc-79f9f1efe3e2","Type":"CreditPoint"},"LearningOutcome":[{"Title":{"En":"Application the theory of perspective, golden section, symmetry and curves"},"RelatedESCOSkill":[{"Notation":"Skill","InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/concept-scheme/skills","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"search for information online"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/skill/698be2d3-8768-422d-a2d3-1cb701816089","Type":"Concept"}],"AdditionalNote":{"NoteLiteral":{"En":"Apply the theory of perspective, golden section, symmetry, curves and surfaces to practical mathematical analysis and design problems."},"Id":"urn:eciu:note:f328067e-d2be-ef11-b8e8-6045bd8e221f","Type":"Note"},"Id":"urn:epass:learningOutcome:115722d3-d6c3-408c-a9bc-79f9f1efe3e2-1","Type":"LearningOutcome"},{"Title":{"En":"The analysis of the buildings\u0027 architecture"},"RelatedESCOSkill":[{"Notation":"Skill","InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/concept-scheme/skills","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"search for information online"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/skill/698be2d3-8768-422d-a2d3-1cb701816089","Type":"Concept"},{"Notation":"Skill","InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/concept-scheme/skills","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"use IT tools"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/skill/f632251a-4078-4546-b19f-7ef528d08325","Type":"Concept"},{"Notation":"Skill","InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/concept-scheme/skills","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"think creatively"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/skill/c624c6a3-b0ba-4a31-a296-0d433fe47e41","Type":"Concept"}],"AdditionalNote":{"NoteLiteral":{"En":"Analyse the architecture of buildings from different perspectives."},"Id":"urn:eciu:note:5d8bb4d1-d2be-ef11-b8e8-6045bd8e221f","Type":"Note"},"Id":"urn:epass:learningOutcome:115722d3-d6c3-408c-a9bc-79f9f1efe3e2-2","Type":"LearningOutcome"}],"LearningSetting":null,"Mode":null,"Title":{"En":"Mathematics in Architecture"},"DcType":null,"HomePage":null,"VolumeOfLearning":null,"Id":"urn:eciu:qualification:115722d3-d6c3-408c-a9bc-79f9f1efe3e2","Type":"Qualification"},"IsPartOf":{"Mode":null,"DcType":null,"Title":{"En":"Mathematics in Architecture"},"AdmissionsProcedure":null,"ApplicationDeadline":null,"Description":null,"LearningAchievementSpecification":null,"IsPartOf":null,"Temporal":null,"ProvidedBy":null,"LearningActivitySpecification":null,"BannerImage":null,"MoreInformation":null,"Id":"urn:eciu:learningOpportunity:b33761cb-201d-ef11-840a-000d3a2a7e23","Type":"LearningOpportunity"},"Temporal":{"EndDate":"2025-05-01T00:00:00Z","Name":{"En":"Temporal"},"StartDate":"2025-06-10T00:00:00Z"},"ProvidedBy":{"Location":null,"Logo":null,"LegalName":{"En":"KAUNO TECHNOLOGIJOS UNIVERSITETAS (KTU)"},"Registration":null,"Homepage":null,"Id":"urn:eciu:org:4cc1e316-6a54-ed11-bba2-6045bd886566","Type":"Organisation"},"LearningActivitySpecification":{"Mode":null,"DcType":null,"Title":{"En":""},"Description":{"En":"[https://uais.cr.ktu.lt/ktuis/stp_report_ects.mdl_ml?p_kodas=MM00M115\u0026p_year=2024\u0026p_lang=EN\u0026p_stp_id=](https://uais.cr.ktu.lt/ktuis/stp_report_ects.mdl_ml?p_kodas=MM00M120\u0026amp;p_year=2024\u0026amp;p_lang=EN\u0026amp;p_stp_id=)"},"MoreInformation":[{"NoteLiteral":"The learning activities and resources implemented in the micromodule are crafted to facilitate the attainment of anticipated learning outcomes, enabling the acquisition of new knowledge and the development of expected skills and competences.
