has heard about green mobility, but replacing physiotherapy by biking? Our idea is to combine green mobility with smart e-bike and health sensors allowing to do exercises prescribed by a doctor.\nThis could be an energy and cost efficient solution to excessive sedentary, one of the worst chronic diseases for humans. Because we are the only living species able to use \u0022transports\u0022, we spend lot of time in seated position even when we travel over longer distances.\n\nSmart E-bikes with some basic monitoring have already been tested and are available at the LAAS-CNRS, one of the INSA Toulouse labs, but we\u0027d like to go further in this challenge and design the \u0022smart e-bike for your health\u0022 of the future. Come and join us for this adventure.
