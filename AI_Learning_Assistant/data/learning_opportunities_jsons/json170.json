However, organizing and broadcasting a cultural event is no easy task. Festivals and municipalities must rethink how they design accessible, sustainable, and engaging experiences for all audiences\u2014including people with disabilities, children, and underprivileged communities.\n\nThis is where our challenge comes in. Stepping into the role of creative engineers, students will collaborate with local stakeholders to develop innovative solutions that make music accessible to everyone. How can we design inclusive experiences that allow people with mobility restrictions or sensory impairments to fully participate in a festival? How can a city ensure that a cultural event reaches all its citizens, regardless of their background? How can we reduce the environmental impact of large-scale music events?\n\nOver just a few days, student teams will tackle these critical questions, combining creativity, technology, and user-centered design to develop concrete, practical solutions. Their work will not only offer fresh perspectives but also provide actionable strategies for local decision-makers."},"LearningAchievementSpecification":{"EQFLevel":{"InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/snb/eqf/25831c2","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"Level
