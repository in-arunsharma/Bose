Designed for students with a background in chemistry or biochemistry, the course provides a comprehensive overview of the biotechnology process, from theoretical concepts to practical application.\n\nYou will begin with self- and group-directed research, working collaboratively to answer a scientific question about lipids. This involves exploring current methods for lipid extraction and analysis and designing your own experimentation protocols. Through guided online sessions, you will refine your approach, integrating feedback from peers and professors to develop a clear plan for laboratory work. The course culminates in a week-long on-site lab experience at INSA Toulouse (from 3 to 6 of June 2025), where you will put your protocols into action. Using a yeast strain with biotechnological applications, you will extract and analyze lipids, gaining practical experience in laboratory techniques. This process will help you connect theoretical knowledge with hands-on experimentation, fostering a deeper understanding of the biotechnological pipeline.\n\nBy the end of the module, you will have honed your research and problem-solving skills, developed the ability to synthesize complex information, and experienced the dynamics of working in a multidisciplinary, international team. This micromodule not only deepens your expertise in biotechnology but also prepares you for real-world challenges in sustainable innovation."},"LearningAchievementSpecification":{"EQFLevel":{"InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/snb/eqf/25831c2","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"Level 6"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/snb/eqf/6","Type":"Concept"},"CreditPoint":{"Framework":{"InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/snb/education-credit/25831c2","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"European Credit Transfer System"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/snb/education-credit/6fcec5c5af","Type":"Concept"},"Point":"3,0","Id":"urn:epass:creditPoint:f0137aab-77c5-4731-9330-6fa77c32ab0d","Type":"CreditPoint"},"LearningOutcome":[{"Title":{"En":"Explain the potential role of vegetable lipids within the bioeconomy."},"RelatedESCOSkill":[{"Notation":"Skill","InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/concept-scheme/skills","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"biotechnology"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/skill/61bef658-d7f9-4759-b1b0-0f9cb3bc581a","Type":"Concept"},{"Notation":"Skill","InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/concept-scheme/skills","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"bioeconomy"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/skill/609d6bb4-db16-4578-87fc-57b11a701cc2","Type":"Concept"}],"AdditionalNote":{"NoteLiteral":{"En":"By the end of this micromodle, you will be able to explain the the concept of the bioeconomy and the role of vegetable lipids as an important synthon for oleochemistry (the study of vegetable and animal fats).
