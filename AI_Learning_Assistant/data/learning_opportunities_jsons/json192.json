The main theories which help to understand consumer acceptance of technology will also be presented. The micromodule is interdisciplinary and covers marketing, business, consumer psychology, and technology disciplines.\n\nEach week, students will be engaged in video lectures, quizzes, readings, discussion forums, and case study analyses. These activities are designed to expand students\u2019 knowledge, and to encourage and strengthen their critical thinking skills. The combination of these learning elements will contribute significantly to the students\u0027 understanding of the subject matter and foster the development of their analytical and critical thinking abilities.\n\nThe relevance of this micromodule lies in its timely exploration of the relationship between AI and consumer behaviour, addressing current industry needs and preparing students for the challenges and opportunities presented by the evolving landscape of digital marketing."},"LearningAchievementSpecification":{"EQFLevel":{"InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/snb/eqf/25831c2","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"Level 7"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/snb/eqf/7","Type":"Concept"},"CreditPoint":{"Framework":{"InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/snb/education-credit/25831c2","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"European Credit Transfer System"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/snb/education-credit/6fcec5c5af","Type":"Concept"},"Point":"2,0","Id":"urn:epass:creditPoint:c2dc1f29-27f0-4f86-aa47-d29ec9c09ee0","Type":"CreditPoint"},"LearningOutcome":[{"Title":{"En":"Understand changes made by AI"},"RelatedESCOSkill":[{"Notation":"Skill","InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/concept-scheme/skills","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"business knowledge"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/skill/fcb2b5f4-3a64-42f2-987a-073bea986104","Type":"Concept"}],"AdditionalNote":{"NoteLiteral":{"En":"Learners will be able to describe consumer behaviour changes, involving aspects such as consumer journey, consumer experience enhancement, chatbots and consumer relationship management, ethical and legal issues, marketing analytics, and predictive analytics, which can be impacted by artificial intelligence."},"Id":"urn:eciu:note:73f9ce08-30bd-ef11-b8e8-6045bd928e93","Type":"Note"},"Id":"urn:epass:learningOutcome:c2dc1f29-27f0-4f86-aa47-d29ec9c09ee0-1","Type":"LearningOutcome"},{"Title":{"En":"Evaluate AI impact on consumer behaviour from two perspectives"},"RelatedESCOSkill":[{"Notation":"Skill","InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/concept-scheme/skills","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"think innovately"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/skill/c2a0c52c-0b4b-4180-a918-92650ea3b458","Type":"Concept"}],"AdditionalNote":{"NoteLiteral":{"En":"Learners be able to evaluate the benefits, value creation, and challenges of AI in the consumer journey from two perspectives: the consumer (user) and the company."},"Id":"urn:eciu:note:355c3369-30bd-ef11-b8e8-6045bd928e93","Type":"Note"},"Id":"urn:epass:learningOutcome:c2dc1f29-27f0-4f86-aa47-d29ec9c09ee0-2","Type":"LearningOutcome"}],"LearningSetting":null,"Mode":null,"Title":{"En":"AI and Consumer Behaviour\u00A0\u200B"},"DcType":null,"HomePage":null,"VolumeOfLearning":"PT0H","Id":"urn:eciu:qualification:c2dc1f29-27f0-4f86-aa47-d29ec9c09ee0","Type":"Qualification"},"IsPartOf":{"Mode":null,"DcType":null,"Title":{"En":"AI and Consumer Behaviour\u00A0\u200B"},"AdmissionsProcedure":null,"ApplicationDeadline":null,"Description":null,"LearningAchievementSpecification":null,"IsPartOf":null,"Temporal":null,"ProvidedBy":null,"LearningActivitySpecification":null,"BannerImage":null,"MoreInformation":null,"Id":"urn:eciu:learningOpportunity:f39ac467-211d-ef11-840a-000d3a2a7e23","Type":"LearningOpportunity"},"Temporal":{"EndDate":"2025-03-17T00:00:00Z","Name":{"En":"Temporal"},"StartDate":"2025-05-02T00:00:00Z"},"ProvidedBy":{"Location":null,"Logo":null,"LegalName":{"En":"KAUNO TECHNOLOGIJOS UNIVERSITETAS (KTU)"},"Registration":null,"Homepage":null,"Id":"urn:eciu:org:4cc1e316-6a54-ed11-bba2-6045bd886566","Type":"Organisation"},"LearningActivitySpecification":{"Mode":null,"DcType":null,"Title":{"En":""},"Description":{"En":"[https://uais.cr.ktu.lt/ktuis/stp_report_ects.mdl_ml?p_kodas=MM00M122\u0026p_year=2024\u0026p_lang=EN\u0026p_stp_id=](https://uais.cr.ktu.lt/ktuis/stp_report_ects.mdl_ml?p_kodas=MM00M118\u0026amp;p_year=2024\u0026amp;p_lang=EN\u0026amp;p_stp_id=)"},"MoreInformation":[{"NoteLiteral":"Every week students will be engaged into five activities: lectures, readings, case studies (from consumer and company perspective),\u00A0discussion forums and quizzes.\n\nEvery week students will get new case study and will have to analyse them from company perspective.
