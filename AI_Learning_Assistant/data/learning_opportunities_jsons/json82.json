Participants will gain practical competences on how to apply the circular business model canvas and develop an environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) reporting strategy based on a double materiality assessment. This aspect focuses on how companies can effectively report on their sustainability practices and impacts.\n\nThe module content is connected to real-world applications as:\n\n- the need to transition to circular business models is a reality. Consumers and employees want businesses to invest in making significant sustainable improvements to the environment and society.\n- 76% of consumers say they will stop buying from companies that treat the environment, employees, or the community in which they operate poorly.\n- the future of corporate sustainability reporting is all about communicating impact, not statistics\u201D.\n\nUnique features of the micromodule are related to the:\n\n- Real world, real impact: explore case studies of circular business models and apply hands-on activities to design (redesign) business models with circular innovation\n- Measure success: master the art of ESG reporting. It\u0027s not just about profit; it\u0027s about making a positive impact on the world.\n\nThis micromodule can be extremely relevant for:\n\n- Business professionals seeking to (re)design sustainable and circular business models.\n- Students and academics in business, sustainability, and related fields.\n- Policymakers and sustainability consultants."},"LearningAchievementSpecification":{"EQFLevel":{"InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/snb/eqf/25831c2","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"Level 7"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/snb/eqf/7","Type":"Concept"},"CreditPoint":{"Framework":{"InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/snb/education-credit/25831c2","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"European Credit Transfer System"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/snb/education-credit/6fcec5c5af","Type":"Concept"},"Point":"2,0","Id":"urn:epass:creditPoint:5f5d94d4-e46f-4deb-9e50-55c391be29d8","Type":"CreditPoint"},"LearningOutcome":[{"Title":{"En":"Apply different circularity strategies for its changes"},"RelatedESCOSkill":[{"Notation":"Skill","InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/concept-scheme/skills","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"promote responsible consumer behaviour"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/skill/e1da04bb-4de8-4d17-af8a-75ea893fe36a","Type":"Concept"},{"Notation":"Skill","InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/concept-scheme/skills","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"identify new recycling opportunities"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/skill/89f5fa96-ae45-4906-902c-d50ca51009c6","Type":"Concept"},{"Notation":"Skill","InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/concept-scheme/skills","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"think innovately"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/skill/c2a0c52c-0b4b-4180-a918-92650ea3b458","Type":"Concept"}],"AdditionalNote":{"NoteLiteral":{"En":"By completing the micromodule, student will be able to define the main principles and functioning conditions of a circular business model and (re)design a business model via different circularity strategies."},"Id":"urn:eciu:note:a928b940-d8be-ef11-b8e8-6045bd8e221f","Type":"Note"},"Id":"urn:epass:learningOutcome:5f5d94d4-e46f-4deb-9e50-55c391be29d8-1","Type":"LearningOutcome"},{"Title":{"En":"Understand the principles of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) reporting"},"RelatedESCOSkill":[{"Notation":"Skill","InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/concept-scheme/skills","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"promote responsible consumer behaviour"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/skill/e1da04bb-4de8-4d17-af8a-75ea893fe36a","Type":"Concept"},{"Notation":"Skill","InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/concept-scheme/skills","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"adopt ways to reduce negative impact of consumption"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/skill/4c3ab565-747c-4db3-8c47-79e8d6f98cf4","Type":"Concept"},{"Notation":"Skill","InScheme":{"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/concept-scheme/skills","Type":"ConceptScheme"},"PrefLabel":{"En":"think holistically"},"Id":"http://data.europa.eu/esco/skill/d56e2c2f-3e01-4b76-a7bb-ecb6d430172f","Type":"Concept"}],"AdditionalNote":{"NoteLiteral":{"En":"By completing the micromodule, student will be able to characterise and specify the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) reporting strategies based on materiality assessment and operating business model."},"Id":"urn:eciu:note:4eed263d-d9be-ef11-b8e8-6045bd8e221f","Type":"Note"},"Id":"urn:epass:learningOutcome:5f5d94d4-e46f-4deb-9e50-55c391be29d8-2","Type":"LearningOutcome"}],"LearningSetting":null,"Mode":null,"Title":{"En":"Circular Business Model"},"DcType":null,"HomePage":null,"VolumeOfLearning":null,"Id":"urn:eciu:qualification:5f5d94d4-e46f-4deb-9e50-55c391be29d8","Type":"Qualification"},"IsPartOf":{"Mode":null,"DcType":null,"Title":{"En":"Circular Business Model"},"AdmissionsProcedure":null,"ApplicationDeadline":null,"Description":null,"LearningAchievementSpecification":null,"IsPartOf":null,"Temporal":null,"ProvidedBy":null,"LearningActivitySpecification":null,"BannerImage":null,"MoreInformation":null,"Id":"urn:eciu:learningOpportunity:aafd9568-201d-ef11-840a-000d3a2a7e23","Type":"LearningOpportunity"},"Temporal":{"EndDate":"2025-04-14T00:00:00Z","Name":{"En":"Temporal"},"StartDate":"2025-05-18T00:00:00Z"},"ProvidedBy":{"Location":null,"Logo":null,"LegalName":{"En":"KAUNO TECHNOLOGIJOS UNIVERSITETAS (KTU)"},"Registration":null,"Homepage":null,"Id":"urn:eciu:org:4cc1e316-6a54-ed11-bba2-6045bd886566","Type":"Organisation"},"LearningActivitySpecification":{"Mode":null,"DcType":null,"Title":{"En":""},"Description":{"En":"[https://uais.cr.ktu.lt/ktuis/stp_report_ects.mdl_ml?p_kodas=MM00M011\u0026p_year=2024\u0026p_lang=EN\u0026p_stp_id=](https://uais.cr.ktu.lt/ktuis/stp_report_ects.mdl_ml?p_kodas=MM00M115\u0026amp;p_year=2024\u0026amp;p_lang=EN\u0026amp;p_stp_id=)"},"MoreInformation":[{"NoteLiteral":"The expected workload of the micro-module is around 14 hours per week.
